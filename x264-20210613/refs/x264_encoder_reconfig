<doc f='x264/x264.h' l='930'>/* x264_encoder_reconfig:
 *      various parameters from x264_param_t are copied.
 *      this takes effect immediately, on whichever frame is encoded next;
 *      due to delay, this may not be the next frame passed to encoder_encode.
 *      if the change should apply to some particular frame, use x264_picture_t-&gt;param instead.
 *      returns 0 on success, negative on parameter validation error.
 *      not all parameters can be changed; see the actual function for a detailed breakdown.
 *
 *      since not all parameters can be changed, moving from preset to preset may not always
 *      fully copy all relevant parameters, but should still work usably in practice. however,
 *      more so than for other presets, many of the speed shortcuts used in ultrafast cannot be
 *      switched out of; using reconfig to switch between ultrafast and other presets is not
 *      recommended without a more fine-grained breakdown of parameters to take this into account. */</doc>
