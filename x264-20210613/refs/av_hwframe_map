 * Map a hardware frame.
 *
 * This has a number of different possible effects, depending on the format
 * and origin of the src and dst frames.  On input, src should be a usable
 * frame with valid buffers and dst should be blank (typically as just created
 * by av_frame_alloc()).  src should have an associated hwframe context, and
 * dst may optionally have a format and associated hwframe context.
 *
 * If src was created by mapping a frame from the hwframe context of dst,
 * then this function undoes the mapping - dst is replaced by a reference to
 * the frame that src was originally mapped from.
 *
 * If both src and dst have an associated hwframe context, then this function
 * attempts to map the src frame from its hardware context to that of dst and
 * then fill dst with appropriate data to be usable there.  This will only be
 * possible if the hwframe contexts and associated devices are compatible -
 * given compatible devices, av_hwframe_ctx_create_derived() can be used to
 * create a hwframe context for dst in which mapping should be possible.
 *
 * If src has a hwframe context but dst does not, then the src frame is
 * mapped to normal memory and should thereafter be usable as a normal frame.
 * If the format is set on dst, then the mapping will attempt to create dst
 * with that format and fail if it is not possible.  If format is unset (is
 * AV_PIX_FMT_NONE) then dst will be mapped with whatever the most appropriate
 * format to use is (probably the sw_format of the src hwframe context).
 *
 * A return value of AVERROR(ENOSYS) indicates that the mapping is not
 * possible with the given arguments and hwframe setup, while other return
 * values indicate that it failed somehow.
 *
 * @param dst Destination frame, to contain the mapping.
 * @param src Source frame, to be mapped.
 * @param flags Some combination of AV_HWFRAME_MAP_* flags.
 * @return Zero on success, negative AVERROR code on failure.
