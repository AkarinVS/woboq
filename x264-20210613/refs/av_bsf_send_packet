<doc f='include/libavcodec/avcodec.h' l='5929'>/**
 * Submit a packet for filtering.
 *
 * After sending each packet, the filter must be completely drained by calling
 * av_bsf_receive_packet() repeatedly until it returns AVERROR(EAGAIN) or
 * AVERROR_EOF.
 *
 * @param pkt the packet to filter. The bitstream filter will take ownership of
 * the packet and reset the contents of pkt. pkt is not touched if an error occurs.
 * This parameter may be NULL, which signals the end of the stream (i.e. no more
 * packets will be sent). That will cause the filter to output any packets it
 * may have buffered internally.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, a negative AVERROR on error.
