 * Force flushing of buffered data.
 *
 * For write streams, force the buffered data to be immediately written to the output,
 * without to wait to fill the internal buffer.
 *
 * For read streams, discard all currently buffered data, and advance the
 * reported file position to that of the underlying stream. This does not
 * read new data, and does not perform any seeks.
