 * Crop the given video AVFrame according to its crop_left/crop_top/crop_right/
 * crop_bottom fields. If cropping is successful, the function will adjust the
 * data pointers and the width/height fields, and set the crop fields to 0.
 *
 * In all cases, the cropping boundaries will be rounded to the inherent
 * alignment of the pixel format. In some cases, such as for opaque hwaccel
 * formats, the left/top cropping is ignored. The crop fields are set to 0 even
 * if the cropping was rounded or ignored.
 *
 * @param frame the frame which should be cropped
 * @param flags Some combination of AV_FRAME_CROP_* flags, or 0.
 *
 * @return &gt;= 0 on success, a negative AVERROR on error. If the cropping fields
 * were invalid, AVERROR(ERANGE) is returned, and nothing is changed.
