 * Scale the image slice in srcSlice and put the resulting scaled
 * slice in the image in dst. A slice is a sequence of consecutive
 * rows in an image.
 *
 * Slices have to be provided in sequential order, either in
 * top-bottom or bottom-top order. If slices are provided in
 * non-sequential order the behavior of the function is undefined.
 *
 * @param c         the scaling context previously created with
 *                  sws_getContext()
 * @param srcSlice  the array containing the pointers to the planes of
 *                  the source slice
 * @param srcStride the array containing the strides for each plane of
 *                  the source image
 * @param srcSliceY the position in the source image of the slice to
 *                  process, that is the number (counted starting from
 *                  zero) in the image of the first row of the slice
 * @param srcSliceH the height of the source slice, that is the number
 *                  of rows in the slice
