 * Create a new device of the specified type from an existing device.
 *
 * If the source device is a device of the target type or was originally
 * derived from such a device (possibly through one or more intermediate
 * devices of other types), then this will return a reference to the
 * existing device of the same type as is requested.
 *
 * Otherwise, it will attempt to derive a new device from the given source
 * device.  If direct derivation to the new type is not implemented, it will
 * attempt the same derivation from each ancestor of the source device in
 * turn looking for an implemented derivation method.
 *
 * @param dst_ctx On success, a reference to the newly-created
 *                AVHWDeviceContext.
 * @param type    The type of the new device to create.
 * @param src_ctx A reference to an existing AVHWDeviceContext which will be
 *                used to create the new device.
 * @param flags   Currently unused; should be set to zero.
 * @return        Zero on success, a negative AVERROR code on failure.
