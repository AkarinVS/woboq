 * Get the maximum data alignment that may be required by FFmpeg.

 * Note that this is affected by the build configuration and the CPU flags mask,
 * so e.g. if the CPU supports AVX, but libavutil has been built with
 * --disable-avx or the AV_CPU_FLAG_AVX flag has been disabled through
 *  av_set_cpu_flags_mask(), then this function will behave as if AVX is not
 *  present.
