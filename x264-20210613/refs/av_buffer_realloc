 * Reallocate a given buffer.
 *
 * @param buf  a buffer reference to reallocate. On success, buf will be
 *             unreferenced and a new reference with the required size will be
 *             written in its place. On failure buf will be left untouched. *buf
 *             may be NULL, then a new buffer is allocated.
 * @param size required new buffer size.
 * @return 0 on success, a negative AVERROR on failure.
 *
 * @note the buffer is actually reallocated with av_realloc() only if it was
 * initially allocated through av_buffer_realloc(NULL) and there is only one
 * reference to it (i.e. the one passed to this function). In all other cases
 * a new buffer is allocated and the data is copied.
