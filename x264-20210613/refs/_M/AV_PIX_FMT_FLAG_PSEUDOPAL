 * The pixel format is &quot;pseudo-paletted&quot;. This means that it contains a
 * fixed palette in the 2nd plane but the palette is fixed/constant for each
 * PIX_FMT. This allows interpreting the data as if it was PAL8, which can
 * in some cases be simpler. Or the data can be interpreted purely based on
 * the pixel format without using the palette.
 * An example of a pseudo-paletted format is AV_PIX_FMT_GRAY8
 *
 * @deprecated This flag is deprecated, and will be removed. When it is removed,
 * the extra palette allocation in AVFrame.data[1] is removed as well. Only
 * actual paletted formats (as indicated by AV_PIX_FMT_FLAG_PAL) will have a
 * palette. Starting with FFmpeg versions which have this flag deprecated, the
 * extra &quot;pseudo&quot; palette is already ignored, and API users are not required to
 * allocate a palette for AV_PIX_FMT_FLAG_PSEUDOPAL formats (it was required
 * before the deprecation, though).
