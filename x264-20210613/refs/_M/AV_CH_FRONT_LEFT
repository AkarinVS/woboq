 * @defgroup channel_masks Audio channel masks
 *
 * A channel layout is a 64-bits integer with a bit set for every channel.
 * The number of bits set must be equal to the number of channels.
 * The value 0 means that the channel layout is not known.
 * @note this data structure is not powerful enough to handle channels
 * combinations that have the same channel multiple times, such as
 * dual-mono.
