 * Retrieve a filtered packet.
 *
 * @param[out] pkt this struct will be filled with the contents of the filtered
 *                 packet. It is owned by the caller and must be freed using
 *                 av_packet_unref() when it is no longer needed.
 *                 This parameter should be &quot;clean&quot; (i.e. freshly allocated
 *                 with av_packet_alloc() or unreffed with av_packet_unref())
 *                 when this function is called. If this function returns
 *                 successfully, the contents of pkt will be completely
 *                 overwritten by the returned data. On failure, pkt is not
 *                 touched.
 *
 * @return 0 on success. AVERROR(EAGAIN) if more packets need to be sent to the
 * filter (using av_bsf_send_packet()) to get more output. AVERROR_EOF if there
 * will be no further output from the filter. Another negative AVERROR value if
 * an error occurs.
 *
 * @note one input packet may result in several output packets, so after sending
 * a packet with av_bsf_send_packet(), this function needs to be called
 * repeatedly until it stops returning 0. It is also possible for a filter to
 * output fewer packets than were sent to it, so this function may return
 * AVERROR(EAGAIN) immediately after a successful av_bsf_send_packet() call.
