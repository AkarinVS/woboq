 * Write a packet to an output media file ensuring correct interleaving.
 *
 * This function will buffer the packets internally as needed to make sure the
 * packets in the output file are properly interleaved in the order of
 * increasing dts. Callers doing their own interleaving should call
 * av_write_frame() instead of this function.
 *
 * Using this function instead of av_write_frame() can give muxers advance
 * knowledge of future packets, improving e.g. the behaviour of the mp4
 * muxer for VFR content in fragmenting mode.
 *
 * @param s media file handle
 * @param pkt The packet containing the data to be written.
 *            &lt;br&gt;
 *            If the packet is reference-counted, this function will take
 *            ownership of this reference and unreference it later when it sees
 *            fit.
 *            The caller must not access the data through this reference after
 *            this function returns. If the packet is not reference-counted,
 *            libavformat will make a copy.
 *            &lt;br&gt;
 *            This parameter can be NULL (at any time, not just at the end), to
 *            flush the interleaving queues.
 *            &lt;br&gt;
 *            Packet&apos;s @ref AVPacket.stream_index &quot;stream_index&quot; field must be
 *            set to the index of the corresponding stream in @ref
 *            AVFormatContext.streams &quot;s-&gt;streams&quot;.
 *            &lt;br&gt;
 *            The timestamps (@ref AVPacket.pts &quot;pts&quot;, @ref AVPacket.dts &quot;dts&quot;)
 *            must be set to correct values in the stream&apos;s timebase (unless the
 *            output format is flagged with the AVFMT_NOTIMESTAMPS flag, then
 *            they can be set to AV_NOPTS_VALUE).
 *            The dts for subsequent packets in one stream must be strictly
 *            increasing (unless the output format is flagged with the
 *            AVFMT_TS_NONSTRICT, then they merely have to be nondecreasing).
 *            @ref AVPacket.duration &quot;duration&quot;) should also be set if known.
 *
 * @return 0 on success, a negative AVERROR on error. Libavformat will always
 *         take care of freeing the packet, even if this function fails.
 *
 * @see av_write_frame(), AVFormatContext.max_interleave_delta
