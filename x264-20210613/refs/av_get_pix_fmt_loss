 * Compute what kind of losses will occur when converting from one specific
 * pixel format to another.
 * When converting from one pixel format to another, information loss may occur.
 * For example, when converting from RGB24 to GRAY, the color information will
 * be lost. Similarly, other losses occur when converting from some formats to
 * other formats. These losses can involve loss of chroma, but also loss of
 * resolution, loss of color depth, loss due to the color space conversion, loss
 * of the alpha bits or loss due to color quantization.
 * av_get_fix_fmt_loss() informs you about the various types of losses
 * which will occur when converting from one pixel format to another.
 *
 * @param[in] dst_pix_fmt destination pixel format
 * @param[in] src_pix_fmt source pixel format
 * @param[in] has_alpha Whether the source pixel format alpha channel is used.
 * @return Combination of flags informing you what kind of losses will occur
 * (maximum loss for an invalid dst_pix_fmt).
