<doc f='include/libavcodec/avcodec.h' l='3325'>/**
     * Video decoding only. Certain video codecs support cropping, meaning that
     * only a sub-rectangle of the decoded frame is intended for display.  This
     * option controls how cropping is handled by libavcodec.
     *
     * When set to 1 (the default), libavcodec will apply cropping internally.
     * I.e. it will modify the output frame width/height fields and offset the
     * data pointers (only by as much as possible while preserving alignment, or
     * by the full amount if the AV_CODEC_FLAG_UNALIGNED flag is set) so that
     * the frames output by the decoder refer only to the cropped area. The
     * crop_* fields of the output frames will be zero.
     *
     * When set to 0, the width/height fields of the output frames will be set
     * to the coded dimensions and the crop_* fields will describe the cropping
     * rectangle. Applying the cropping is left to the caller.
     *
     * @warning When hardware acceleration with opaque output frames is used,
     * libavcodec is unable to apply cropping from the top/left border.
     *
     * @note when this option is set to zero, the width/height fields of the
     * AVCodecContext and output AVFrames have different meanings. The codec
     * context fields store display dimensions (with the coded dimensions in
     * coded_width/height), while the frame fields store the coded dimensions
     * (with the display dimensions being determined by the crop_* fields).
