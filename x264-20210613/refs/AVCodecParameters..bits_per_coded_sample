     * The number of bits per sample in the codedwords.
     *
     * This is basically the bitrate per sample. It is mandatory for a bunch of
     * formats to actually decode them. It&apos;s the number of bits for one sample in
     * the actual coded bitstream.
     *
     * This could be for example 4 for ADPCM
     * For PCM formats this matches bits_per_raw_sample
     * Can be 0
