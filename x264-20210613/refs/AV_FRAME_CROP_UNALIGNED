     * AVFrame.data[] entries to unaligned pointers. Passing unaligned data
     * to FFmpeg API is generally not allowed, and causes undefined behavior
     * (such as crashes). You can pass unaligned data only to FFmpeg APIs that
     * are explicitly documented to accept it. Use this flag only if you
     * absolutely know what you are doing.
