<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Support/GenericDomTree.h' l='789'>/// verify - checks if the tree is correct. There are 3 level of verification:
  ///  - Full --  verifies if the tree is correct by making sure all the
  ///             properties (including the parent and the sibling property)
  ///             hold.
  ///             Takes O(N^3) time.
  ///
  ///  - Basic -- checks if the tree is correct, but compares it to a freshly
  ///             constructed tree instead of checking the sibling property.
  ///             Takes O(N^2) time.
  ///
  ///  - Fast  -- checks basic tree structure and compares it with a freshly
  ///             constructed tree.
  ///             Takes O(N^2) time worst case, but is faster in practise (same
  ///             as tree construction).</doc>
