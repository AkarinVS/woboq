     * of Product. If the Product itself is not a packet-access expression, there is still a chance that the inner
     * loop of the product might be vectorized. This is the meaning of CanVectorizeInner. Since it doesn&apos;t affect
     * the Flags, it is safe to make this value depend on ActualPacketAccessBit, that doesn&apos;t affect the ABI.
