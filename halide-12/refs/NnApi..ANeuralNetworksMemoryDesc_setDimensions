   * Set the dimensional information of the memory descriptor.
   *
   * The specified dimensions must be compatible with the dimensions of the
   * corresponding model operands of all the roles specified by
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addInputRole} and
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addOutputRole}. Two dimensions are
   * incompatible if both ranks are fully specified but have different values,
   * or if there is at least one axis that is fully specified in both but has
   * different values.
   *
   * Attempting to modify a memory descriptor once
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_finish} has been called will return an
   * error.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * Available since API level 30.
   *
   * @param desc The memory descriptor to be modified.
   * @param rank The number of dimensions. Must be 0 for scalars.
   * @param dimensions An array of dimensions. An entry with the value 0
   * indicates that the corresponding axis has an unknown size.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
