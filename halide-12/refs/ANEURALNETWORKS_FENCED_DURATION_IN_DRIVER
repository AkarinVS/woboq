  // Excludes
  // overhead such as that of the runtime itself and the IPC needed for the
  // runtime
  // to communicate with the driver.
  // If no dependencies specified (for example, if the execution was scheduled
  // other
  // than with {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_startComputeWithDependencies}),
  // the
  // reported time will be the same as ANEURALNETWORKS_DURATION_IN_DRIVER.
  // Available since API level 30.</doc>
