<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Passes/PassBuilder.h' l='358'>/// Construct the core LLVM module optimization pipeline.
  ///
  /// This pipeline focuses on optimizing the execution speed of the IR. It
  /// uses cost modeling and thresholds to balance code growth against runtime
  /// improvements. It includes vectorization and other information destroying
  /// transformations. It also cannot generally be run repeatedly on a module
  /// without potentially seriously regressing either runtime performance of
  /// the code or serious code size growth.
  ///
  /// Note that \p Level cannot be `O0` here. The pipelines produced are
  /// only intended for use when attempting to optimize code. If frontends
  /// require some transformations for semantic reasons, they should explicitly
  /// build them.</doc>
