<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/ExecutionEngine.h' l='251'>/// generateCodeForModule - Run code generation for the specified module and
  /// load it into memory.
  ///
  /// When this function has completed, all code and data for the specified
  /// module, and any module on which this module depends, will be generated
  /// and loaded into memory, but relocations will not yet have been applied
  /// and all memory will be readable and writable but not executable.
  ///
  /// This function is primarily useful when generating code for an external
  /// target, allowing the client an opportunity to remap section addresses
  /// before relocations are applied.  Clients that intend to execute code
  /// locally can use the getFunctionAddress call, which will generate code
  /// and apply final preparations all in one step.
  ///
  /// This method has no effect for the interpeter.</doc>
