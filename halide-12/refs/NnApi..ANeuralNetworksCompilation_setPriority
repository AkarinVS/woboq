   * Set the execution priority.
   *
   * Execution priorities are relative to other executions created by the same
   * application (specifically same uid) for the same device. Specifically,
   * priorities of executions from one application will not affect executions
   * from another application. Similarly, priorities of executions on one device
   * will not affect executions on another device.
   *
   * Higher priority executions may use more compute resources than lower
   * priority executions, and may preempt or starve lower priority executions.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * Available since API level 30.
   *
   * @param compilation The compilation to be modified.
   * @param priority The relative priority of the execution compared to other
   *     executions created by the application. Must be one of
   *     ANEURALNETWORKS_PRIORITY_*.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
