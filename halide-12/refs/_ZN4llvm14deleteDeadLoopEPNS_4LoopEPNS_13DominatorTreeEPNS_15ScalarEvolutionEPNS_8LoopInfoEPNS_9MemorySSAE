<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Transforms/Utils/LoopUtils.h' l='169'>/// This function deletes dead loops. The caller of this function needs to
/// guarantee that the loop is infact dead.
/// The function requires a bunch or prerequisites to be present:
///   - The loop needs to be in LCSSA form
///   - The loop needs to have a Preheader
///   - A unique dedicated exit block must exist
///
/// This also updates the relevant analysis information in \p DT, \p SE, \p LI
/// and \p MSSA if pointers to those are provided.
/// It also updates the loop PM if an updater struct is provided.</doc>
