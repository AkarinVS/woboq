<doc f='halide/build-apps/_deps/tflite-src/tensorflow/lite/core/subgraph.h' l='561'>// WARNING: This is an experimental API and subject to change.
  // Allow a delegate to look at the graph and modify the graph to handle
  // parts of the graph themselves. After this is called, the graph may
  // contain new nodes that replace 1 more nodes.
  // NOTE: If tensors were allocated prior to delegate application, they will
  // be reallocated if the graph was modified (i.e., the caller does *not* need
  // to explicitly call |AllocateTensors()| again). If tensors were unallocated,
  // they will remain unallocated after delegate application.
  // Returns one of the following status codes:
  // 1. kTfLiteOk: Delegation succeeded
  // 2. kTfLiteDelegateError: Delegation failed due to an error *in the
  // delegate*, or the delegate parameter was null. The Subgraph has been
  // restored to its pre-delegation state.
  // NOTE: This reverts all delegates previously applied to the Subgraph.
  // 3. kTfLiteApplicationError : Delegation failed to be applied due to the
  // incompatibility with the TfLite runtime, e.g., the model graph is already
  // immutable when applying the delegate. However, the Subgraph is still in a
  // invokable state.
  // 4. kTfLiteError: Unexpected/runtime failure.</doc>
