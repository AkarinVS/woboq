   * Associate a user buffer with an input of the model of the
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution}.
   *
   * &lt;p&gt;The provided buffer must outlive the execution.&lt;/p&gt;
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * @param execution The execution to be modified.
   * @param index The index of the input argument we are setting. It is
   *              an index into the lists passed to
   *              {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_identifyInputsAndOutputs}. It is
   *              not the index associated with {@link
   * ANeuralNetworksModel_addOperand}.
   * @param type The type of the operand. This should be used to specify the
   *             dimensions that were set to 0 when the operand was added to the
   *             model. All other properties of the type must be the same as
   *             specified in the model. If the type is the same as specified
   *             when the model was built, NULL can be passed.
   * @param buffer The buffer containing the data.
   * @param length The length in bytes of the buffer.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful, ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA if
   * the name is not recognized or the buffer is too small for the input.
