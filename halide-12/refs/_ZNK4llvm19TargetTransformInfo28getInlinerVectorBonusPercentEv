<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Analysis/TargetTransformInfo.h' l='295'>/// \returns Vector bonus in percent.
  ///
  /// Vector bonuses: We want to more aggressively inline vector-dense kernels
  /// and apply this bonus based on the percentage of vector instructions. A
  /// bonus is applied if the vector instructions exceed 50% and half that
  /// amount is applied if it exceeds 10%. Note that these bonuses are some what
  /// arbitrary and evolved over time by accident as much as because they are
  /// principled bonuses.
  /// FIXME: It would be nice to base the bonus values on something more
  /// scientific. A target may has no bonus on vector instructions.</doc>
