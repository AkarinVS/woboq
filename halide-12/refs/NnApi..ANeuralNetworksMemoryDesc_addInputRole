   * Specify that a memory object will be playing the role of an input to an
   * execution created from a particular compilation.
   *
   * The compilation and the input index fully specify an input operand. This
   * function may be invoked multiple times on the same memory descriptor with
   * different input operands, and the same input operand may be specified on
   * multiple memory descriptors. However, specifying the same input operand on
   * the same memory descriptor more than once will return an error.
   *
   * The dimensions of the corresponding model operands of all the roles
   * specified by
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addInputRole} and
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addOutputRole} must be compatible with
   * each other. Two dimensions are incompatible if both ranks are fully
   * specified but have different values, or if there is at least one axis that
   * is fully specified in both but has different values.
   *
   * At least one of {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addInputRole} and
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addOutputRole} must be called on a memory
   * descriptor before invoking {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_finish}.
   *
   * Attempting to modify a memory descriptor once
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_finish} has been called will return an
   * error.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * Available since API level 30.
   *
   * @param desc The memory descriptor to be modified.
   * @param compilation The compilation object. It must already have been
   * finished by calling {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation_finish}, and must
   * outlive the memory descriptor.
   * @param index The index of the input argument we are referencing from the
   * compilation. It is an index into the inputs list passed to
   *              {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_identifyInputsAndOutputs}. It is
   * not the index associated with {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_addOperand}.
   * @param frequency A floating-point value within the range (0.0, 1.0].
   * Describes how likely the memory is to be used in the specified role. This
   * is provided as a hint to optimize the case when different roles prefer
   * different memory locations or data layouts.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
