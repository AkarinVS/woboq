<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Support/FileSystem.h' l='1151'>/// @brief Close the file object.  This should be used instead of ::close for
/// portability. On error, the caller should assume the file is closed, as is
/// the case for Process::SafelyCloseFileDescriptor
///
/// @param F On input, this is the file to close.  On output, the file is
/// set to kInvalidFile.
///
/// @returns An error code if closing the file failed. Typically, an error here
/// means that the filesystem may have failed to perform some buffered writes.</doc>
