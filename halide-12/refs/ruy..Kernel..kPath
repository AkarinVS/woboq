<doc f='halide/build-apps/ruy/ruy/kernel.h' l='177'>// Each Kernel specialization defines kPath as the ground-truth path that it
  // implements. This is used in assertions. As we support fallbacks between
  // paths (see RUY_INHERIT_KERNEL), Unless a specialization for a specific set
  // of template parameters was defined, it is normal for template
  // instantiations of the form Kernel&lt;SomePath, ...&gt; to have kPath!=SomePath.
  // Assertions that kPath==SomePath are used in places where we know that we
  // should be using a template specialization for a specific path rather than a
  // fallback.</doc>
