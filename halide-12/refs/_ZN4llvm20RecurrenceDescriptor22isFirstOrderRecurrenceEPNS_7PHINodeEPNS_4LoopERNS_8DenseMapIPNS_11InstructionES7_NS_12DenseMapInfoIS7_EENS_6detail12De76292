<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Analysis/IVDescriptors.h' l='165'>/// Returns true if Phi is a first-order recurrence. A first-order recurrence
  /// is a non-reduction recurrence relation in which the value of the

  /// previous iteration. \p SinkAfter includes pairs of instructions where the
  /// first will be rescheduled to appear after the second if/when the loop is
  /// vectorized. It may be augmented with additional pairs if needed in order
  /// to handle Phi as a first-order recurrence.</doc>
