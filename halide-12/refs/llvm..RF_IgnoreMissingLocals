<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Transforms/Utils/ValueMapper.h' l='74'>/// If this flag is set, the remapper ignores missing function-local entries
  /// (Argument, Instruction, BasicBlock) that are not in the value map.  If it
  /// is unset, it aborts if an operand is asked to be remapped which doesn&apos;t
  /// exist in the mapping.
  ///
  /// There are no such assertions in MapValue(), whose results are almost
  /// unchanged by this flag.  This flag mainly changes the assertion behaviour
  /// in RemapInstruction().
  ///
  /// Since an Instruction&apos;s metadata operands (even that point to SSA values)
  /// aren&apos;t guaranteed to be dominated by their definitions, MapMetadata will
  /// return &quot;!{}&quot; instead of &quot;null&quot; for \a LocalAsMetadata instances whose SSA
  /// values are unmapped when this flag is set.  Otherwise, \a MapValue()
  /// completely ignores this flag.
  ///
  /// \a MapMetadata() always ignores this flag.</doc>
