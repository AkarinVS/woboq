<doc f='halide/build-apps/abseil-cpp/absl/base/internal/spinlock.cc' l='190'>// We use the upper 29 bits of the lock word to store the time spent waiting to
// acquire this lock.  This is reported by contentionz profiling.  Since the
// lower bits of the cycle counter wrap very quickly on high-frequency
// processors we divide to reduce the granularity to 2^PROFILE_TIMESTAMP_SHIFT
// sized units.  On a 4Ghz machine this will lose track of wait times greater
// than (2^29/4 Ghz)*128 =~ 17.2 seconds.  Such waits should be extremely rare.</doc>
