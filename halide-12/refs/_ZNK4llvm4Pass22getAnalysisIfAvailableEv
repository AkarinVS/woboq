  /// get analysis information that might be around, for example to update it.
  /// This is different than getAnalysis in that it can fail (if the analysis
  /// results haven&apos;t been computed), so should only be used if you can handle
  /// the case when the analysis is not available.  This method is often used by
  /// transformation APIs to update analysis results for a pass automatically as
