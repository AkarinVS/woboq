<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/ExecutionEngine.h' l='309'>/// addGlobalMapping - Tell the execution engine that the specified global is
  /// at the specified location.  This is used internally as functions are JIT&apos;d
  /// and as global variables are laid out in memory.  It can and should also be
  /// used by clients of the EE that want to have an LLVM global overlay
  /// existing data in memory. Values to be mapped should be named, and have
  /// external or weak linkage. Mappings are automatically removed when their
  /// GlobalValue is destroyed.</doc>
