//
// Designates the flag (which is usually pre-existing) as &quot;retired.&quot; A retired
// flag is a flag that is now unused by the program, but may still be passed on
// the command line, usually by production scripts. A retired flag is ignored
// and code can&apos;t access it at runtime.
//
// This macro registers a retired flag with given name and type, with a name
// identical to the name of the original flag you are retiring. The retired
// flag&apos;s type can change over time, so that you can retire code to support a
// custom flag type.
//
// This macro has the same signature as `ABSL_FLAG`. To retire a flag, simply
// replace an `ABSL_FLAG` definition with `ABSL_RETIRED_FLAG`, leaving the
// arguments unchanged (unless of course you actually want to retire the flag
// type at this time as well).
//
// `default_value` is only used as a double check on the type. `explanation` is
// unused.
// TODO(rogeeff): Return an anonymous struct instead of bool, and place it into
// the unnamed namespace.</doc>
