<doc f='include/python3.8/cpython/abstract.h' l='47'>/* Suggested size (number of positional arguments) for arrays of PyObject*
   allocated on a C stack to avoid allocating memory on the heap memory. Such
   array is used to pass positional arguments to call functions of the
   _PyObject_Vectorcall() family.

   The size is chosen to not abuse the C stack and so limit the risk of stack
   overflow. The size is also chosen to allow using the small stack for most
   function calls of the Python standard library. On 64-bit CPU, it allocates
   40 bytes on the stack. */</doc>
