<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/IR/Constants.h' l='1081'>/// Return the identity constant for a binary opcode.
  /// The identity constant C is defined as X op C = X and C op X = X for every
  /// X when the binary operation is commutative. If the binop is not
  /// commutative, callers can acquire the operand 1 identity constant by
  /// setting AllowRHSConstant to true. For example, any shift has a zero
  /// identity constant for operand 1: X shift 0 = X.
  /// Return nullptr if the operator does not have an identity constant.</doc>
