   * Get the version of the driver implementation of the specified device.
   *
   * It’s the responsibility of the driver implementor to insure that this
   * version string uniquely distinguishes this implementation from all previous
   * implementations.
   *
   * This version string must not be confused with the feature level which is
   * solely defined by {@link ANeuralNetworksDevice_getFeatureLevel}. There is
   * no implicit ordering of the versions. For example, it is not possible to
   * filter all drivers older than a certain version.
   *
   * Application developers may use this version string to avoid or prefer
   * specific driver implementations. For example, an application may want to do
   * so because:
   *     - A specific version of the driver does not provide the required
   * performance, perhaps because of a performance regression.
   *     - A specific version of the driver has a bug or returns results that
   * don’t match the minimum precision requirement for the application.
   *
   * @param device  The representation of the specified device.
   * @param version The returned version string of the driver for the specified
   *                device. The string will be in UTF-8 and will be
   *                null-terminated. For devices with feature level 28 or lower,
   *                &quot;UNKNOWN&quot; will be returned. The version string will remain
   *                valid for the duration of the application.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
   *
   * Available since API level 29.
