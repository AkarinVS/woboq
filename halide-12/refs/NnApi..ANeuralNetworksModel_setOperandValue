   * Sets an operand to a constant value.
   *
   * For scalar values, the content of buffer is copied into the model.
   *
   * For tensor values, a pointer to the buffer is stored within the model.
   * The application is responsible for not changing the content of this region
   * until all executions using this model have completed. As the data may
   * be copied during processing, modifying the data after this call yields
   * undefined results.
   *
   * Attempting to modify a model once {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_finish} has
   * been called will return an error.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksModel} for information on multithreaded usage.
   *
   * @param model The model to be modified.
   * @param index The index of the model operand we&apos;re setting.
   * @param buffer A pointer to the data to use.
   * @param length The size in bytes of the data value.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
