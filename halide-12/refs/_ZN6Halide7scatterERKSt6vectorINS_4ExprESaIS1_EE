<doc f='halide/halide-install/include/Halide.h' l='8277'>/** Scatter and gather are used for update definition which must store
 * multiple values to distinct locations at the same time. The
 * multiple expressions on the right-hand-side are bundled together
 * into a &quot;gather&quot;, which must match a &quot;scatter&quot; the the same number
 * of arguments on the left-hand-size. For example, to store the
 * values 1 and 2 to the locations (x, y, 3) and (x, y, 4),
 * respectively:
 *
\code
f(x, y, scatter(3, 4)) = gather(1, 2);
\endcode
 *
 * The result of gather or scatter can be treated as an
 * expression. Any containing operations on it can be assumed to
 * distribute over the elements. If two gather expressions are
 * combined with an arithmetic operator (e.g. added), they combine
 * element-wise. The following example stores the values 2 * x, 2 * y,
 * and 2 * c to the locations (x + 1, y, c), (x, y + 3, c), and (x, y,
 * c + 2) respectively:
 *
\code
f(x + scatter(1, 0, 0), y + scatter(0, 3, 0), c + scatter(0, 0, 2)) = 2 * gather(x, y, c);
\endcode
*
* Repeated values in the scatter cause multiple stores to the same
* location. The stores happen in order from left to right, so the
* rightmost value wins. The following code is equivalent to f(x) = 5
*
\code
f(scatter(x, x)) = gather(3, 5);
\endcode
*
* Gathers are most useful for algorithms which require in-place
* swapping or permutation of multiple elements, or other kinds of
* in-place mutations that require loading multiple inputs, doing some
* operations to them jointly, then storing them again. The following
* update definition swaps the values of f at locations 3 and 5 if an
* input parameter p is true:
*
\code
f(scatter(3, 5)) = f(select(p, gather(5, 3), gather(3, 5)));
\endcode
*
* For more examples of the use of scatter and gather, see
* test/correctness/multiple_scatter.cpp
*
* It is not currently possible to use scatter and gather to write an
* update definition in which the *number* of values loaded or stored
* varies, as the size of the scatter/gather packet must be fixed a
* compile-time. A workaround is to make the unwanted extra operations
* a redundant copy of the last operation, which will be
* dead-code-eliminated by the compiler. For example, the following
* update definition swaps the values at locations 3 and 5 when the
* parameter p is true, and rotates the values at locations 1, 2, and 3
* when it is false. The load from 3 and store to 5 will be redundantly
* repeated:
*
\code
f(select(p, scatter(3, 5, 5), scatter(1, 2, 3))) = f(select(p, gather(5, 3, 3), gather(2, 3, 1)));
\endcode
*
* Note that in the p == true case, we redudantly load from 3 and write
* to 5 twice.
