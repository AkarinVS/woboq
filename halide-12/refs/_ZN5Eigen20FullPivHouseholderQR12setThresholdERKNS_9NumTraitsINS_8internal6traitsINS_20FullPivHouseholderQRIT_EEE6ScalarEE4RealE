<doc f='halide/build-apps/eigen/Eigen/src/QR/FullPivHouseholderQR.h' l='327'>/** Allows to prescribe a threshold to be used by certain methods, such as rank(),
      * who need to determine when pivots are to be considered nonzero. This is not used for the
      * QR decomposition itself.
      *
      * When it needs to get the threshold value, Eigen calls threshold(). By default, this
      * uses a formula to automatically determine a reasonable threshold.
      * Once you have called the present method setThreshold(const RealScalar&amp;),
      * your value is used instead.
      *
      * \param threshold The new value to use as the threshold.
      *
      * A pivot will be considered nonzero if its absolute value is strictly greater than
      *  \f$ \vert pivot \vert \leqslant threshold \times \vert maxpivot \vert \f$
      * where maxpivot is the biggest pivot.
      *
      * If you want to come back to the default behavior, call setThreshold(Default_t)
