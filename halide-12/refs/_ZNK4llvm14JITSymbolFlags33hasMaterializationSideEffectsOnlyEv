<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/JITSymbol.h' l='151'>/// Returns true if this symbol is a materialization-side-effects-only
  /// symbol. Such symbols do not have a real address. They exist to trigger
  /// and support synchronization of materialization side effects, e.g. for
  /// collecting initialization information. These symbols will vanish from
  /// the symbol table immediately upon reaching the ready state, and will
  /// appear to queries as if they were never defined (except that query
  /// callback execution will be delayed until they reach the ready state).
  /// MaterializationSideEffectOnly symbols should only be queried using the
  /// SymbolLookupFlags::WeaklyReferencedSymbol flag (see
  /// llvm/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/Orc/Core.h).</doc>
