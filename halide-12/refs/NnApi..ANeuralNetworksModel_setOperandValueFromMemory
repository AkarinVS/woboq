   * Sets an operand to a value stored in a memory object.
   *
   * The content of the memory is not copied. A reference to that memory is
   * stored inside the model. The application is responsible for not changing
   * the content of the memory region until all executions using this model have
   * completed.
   * As the data may be copied during processing, modifying the data after this
   * call yields undefined results.
   *
   * Attempting to modify a model once {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_finish} has
   * been called will return an error.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksModel} for information on multithreaded usage.
   *
   * @param model The model to be modified.
   * @param index The index of the model operand we&apos;re setting.
   * @param buffer A pointer to the data to use.
   * @param memory The memory containing the data.
   * @param offset This specifies the location of the data within the memory.
   *               The offset is in bytes from the start of memory.
   * @param length The size in bytes of the data value.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
