   * Creates a memory object from a memory descriptor.
   *
   * The memory object is created with an uninitialized buffer. A memory object
   * with an uninitialized buffer may only be used according to the roles
   * specified by
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addOutputRole}, or as the destination
   * memory in
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory_copy}. The buffer of a memory object is
   * initialized after the memory object is used as an output in a successful
   * execution, or used as the destination memory in a successful {@link
   * ANeuralNetworksMemory_copy}. A memory object with an initialized buffer may
   * be used according to all roles specified in
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc}, or as the source or destination memory
   * in
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory_copy}. The buffer of a memory object will
   * return to the uninitialized state if the memory object is used as an output
   * in a failed execution, or used as the destination memory in a failed {@link
   * ANeuralNetworksMemory_copy}.
   *
   * The dimensions of the memory descriptor are deduced from the dimensions of
   * the corresponding model operands of all the roles specified by
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addInputRole} and
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_addOutputRole}, as well as the dimensions
   * set by the call to {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc_setDimensions}, if any.
   * The memory descriptor may have unspecified dimensions or rank. In such a
   * case, the same memory object may be used with different shapes of outputs
   * in different executions. When the memory is used as an input, the input
   * shape must be the same as the output shape from the last execution using
   * this memory object as an output, or the last
   * {@link ANeuralNetworkMemory_copy} using this memory object as the
   * destination memory. Creating a memory object with unspecified dimensions or
   * rank may fail for certain sets of roles.
   *
   * Using the memory in roles or shapes that are not compatible with the rules
   * specified above will return an error.
   *
   * When calling {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setInputFromMemory} or
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setOutputFromMemory} with the memory
   * object, both offset and length must be set to zero and the entire memory
   * region will be associated with the specified input or output operand.
   *
   * Calling {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_setOperandValueFromMemory} with the
   * memory created from this function will return an error.
   *
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory_free} must be called once the memory is no
   * longer needed.
   *
   * Attempting to create memory from an unfinished memory descriptor will
   * return an error.
   *
   * The provided {@link ANeuralNetworksMemoryDesc} need not outlive the
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory} object.
   *
   * Available since API level 30.
   *
   * @param desc The memory descriptor.
   * @param memory The memory object to be created.
   *               Set to NULL if unsuccessful.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful; ANEURALNETWORKS_OP_FAILED
   * if the memory is created with unspecified dimensions or rank and it is not
   * supported for this set of roles.
