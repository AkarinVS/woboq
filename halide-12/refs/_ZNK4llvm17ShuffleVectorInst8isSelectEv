  /// without lane crossings and all operands have the same number of elements.
  /// In other words, this shuffle is equivalent to a vector select with a
  /// constant condition operand.
  /// Example: shufflevector &lt;4 x n&gt; A, &lt;4 x n&gt; B, &lt;undef,1,6,3&gt;
  /// This returns false if the mask does not choose from both input vectors.
  /// In that case, the shuffle is better classified as an identity shuffle.
