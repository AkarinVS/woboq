 * automatically on each pipeline invocation; however, it costs a
 * small but possibly significant amount of time for short running
 * pipelines. To avoid this cost, HVX can be powered on prior to
 * running several pipelines, and powered off afterwards. If HVX is
 * powered on, subsequent calls to power HVX on will be cheap. */
