   * Get the supported operations for a specified set of devices. If multiple
   * devices are selected, the supported operation list is a union of supported
   * operations of all selected devices.
   *
   * @param model        The model to be queried.
   * @param devices      The set of devices. Must not contain duplicates.
   * @param numDevices   The number of devices in the set.
   * @param supportedOps The boolean array to be filled. True means supported.
   *                     The size of the boolean array must be at least as large
   *                     as the number of operations in the model. The order of
   *                     elements in the supportedOps array matches the order in
   *                     which the corresponding operations were added to the
   *                     model.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
   *
   * Available since API level 29.
