   * Set the maximum expected duration of the specified execution.
   *
   * If the device is not able to complete the execution within the specified
   * duration, the execution may be aborted. The timeout duration begins at a
   * call to one of:
   * - {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_burstCompute}
   * - {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_compute}
   * - {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_startCompute}
   * - {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_startComputeWithDependencies}
   *
   * This timeout duration acts as a hint to drivers, and can be used to both
   * free up compute resources within the driver and return control back to the
   * application quicker than is possible without the hint. It enables drivers
   * that are able to estimate how long an execution will take to abort the
   * execution before it has even started if the driver believes the execution
   * cannot be completed within the timeout duration. Similarly, it enables
   * drivers to abort an ongoing execution if it is taking too long. However,
   * this call does not guarantee that the execution will complete or abort
   * within the timeout duration.
   *
   * By default (i.e., unless ANeuralNetworksExecution_setTimeout is called),
   * the timeout duration for execution is considered infinite.
   *
   * The {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} must have been created from an
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation} which in turn was created from
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation_createForDevices} with numDevices = 1,
   * otherwise this function will fail with ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA. If the
   * device has a feature level reported by
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksDevice_getFeatureLevel} that is lower than 30, then
   * the timeout duration hint will be ignored.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * @param execution The execution to be modified.
   * @param duration The maximum amount of time in nanoseconds that is expected
   * to be spent executing a model. If this duration is exceeded, the execution
   *     may be aborted. If set to 0, the timeout duration is considered
   * infinite.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
   *
   * Available since API level 30.
