     * Returns a proxy object that provides const access to the array&apos;s data without bounds or
     * dimensionality checking.  Unlike `mutable_unchecked()`, this does not require that the
     * underlying array have the `writable` flag.  Use with care: the array must not be destroyed or
     * reshaped for the duration of the returned object, and the caller must take care not to access
     * invalid dimensions or dimension indices.
