   * Creates a shared memory object from an AHardwareBuffer handle.
   *
   * If the shared memory is backed by an AHardwareBuffer of
   * AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_BLOB format, it can be used the same way as
   * shared memory created from a file handle. See
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksMemory} for a description on how to use this
   * shared memory.
   *
   * If the shared memory is backed by an AHardwareBuffer of a format other
   * than AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_BLOB, it can only be used for Model inputs
   * and outputs. When calling
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setInputFromMemory} or
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setOutputFromMemory} with the shared
   * memory, both offset and length must be set to zero and the entire
   * memory region will be associated with the specified input or output
   * operand. There is no guarantee that an arbitrary AHardwareBuffer_Format
   * and AHardwareBuffer_UsageFlags combination can be used by arbitrary
   * devices. The execution will fail if selected set of devices cannot
   * consume the buffer.
   *
   * Calling {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_setOperandValueFromMemory} with
   * shared memory backed by an AHardwareBuffer of a format other than
   * AHARDWAREBUFFER_FORMAT_BLOB is disallowed.
   *
   * TODO(miaowang): add documentation about intended usage with
   * introspection API.
   *
   * Available since API level 29.
   *
   * @param ahwb The AHardwareBuffer handle.
   * @param memory The memory object to be created.
   *               Set to NULL if unsuccessful.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if the request completed normally.
