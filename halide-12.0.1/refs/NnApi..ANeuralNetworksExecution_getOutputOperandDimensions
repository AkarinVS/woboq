   * Get the dimensional information of the specified output operand of the
   * model of the
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution}. The target output operand cannot be a
   * scalar.
   *
   * On asynchronous execution initiated by {@link
   * ANeuralNetworksExecution_startCompute},
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksEvent_wait} must be called prior to this function to
   * recuperate the resources used by the execution.
   *
   * @param execution The execution to be queried.
   * @param index The index of the output argument we are querying. It is an
   *              index into the lists passed to
   *              {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_identifyInputsAndOutputs}. It is
   *              not the index associated with
   *              {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_addOperand}.
   * @param dimensions The dimension array to be filled. The size of the array
   *                   must be exactly as large as the rank of the output
   *                   operand to be queried in the model.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful,
   *         ANEURALNETWORKS_OUTPUT_INSUFFICIENT_SIZE if the target output is
   *         provided an insufficient buffer at execution time,
   *         ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA if the index is invalid or if the target
   *         is a scalar.
   *
   * Available since API level 29.
