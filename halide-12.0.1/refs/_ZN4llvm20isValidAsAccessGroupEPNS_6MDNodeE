<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Analysis/LoopInfo.h' l='1286'>/// Return whether an MDNode might represent an access group.
///
/// Access group metadata nodes have to be distinct and empty. Being
/// always-empty ensures that it never needs to be changed (which -- because
/// MDNodes are designed immutable -- would require creating a new MDNode). Note
/// that this is not a sufficient condition: not every distinct and empty NDNode
