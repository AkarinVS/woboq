  // Methods for handling the chain of uses of this Value.
  //
  // Materializing a function can introduce new uses, so these methods come in
  // two variants:
  // The methods that start with materialized_ check the uses that are
  // currently known given which functions are materialized. Be very careful
  // when using them since you might not get all uses.
  // The methods that don&apos;t start with materialized_ assert that modules is
  // fully materialized.</doc>
