/// This is designed for cases where functions appear to become dead but remain
/// alive due to other live entries in their comdat group.

/// The \p DeadComdatFunctions container should only have pointers to
/// `Function`s which are members of a comdat group and are believed to be

/// After this routine finishes, the only remaining `Function`s in \p
/// DeadComdatFunctions are those where every member of the comdat is listed
