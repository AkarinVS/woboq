<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/RuntimeDyld.h' l='250'>/// Perform all actions needed to make the code owned by this RuntimeDyld
  /// instance executable:
  ///
  /// 1) Apply relocations.
  /// 2) Register EH frames.
  /// 3) Update memory permissions*.
  ///
  /// * Finalization is potentially recursive**, and the 3rd step will only be
  ///   applied by the outermost call to finalize. This allows different
  ///   RuntimeDyld instances to share a memory manager without the innermost
  ///   finalization locking the memory and causing relocation fixup errors in
  ///   outer instances.
  ///
  /// ** Recursive finalization occurs when one RuntimeDyld instances needs the
  ///   address of a symbol owned by some other instance in order to apply
  ///   relocations.
