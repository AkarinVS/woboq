   * Get sync_fence file descriptor from the event.
   *
   * If the ANeuralNetworksEvent is not backed by a sync fence, the
   * sync_fence_fd will be set to -1, and ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA will be
   * returned.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksEvent_createFromSyncFenceFd} and
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_startComputeWithDependencies} to see how to
   * create an event backed by a sync fence.
   *
   * The user takes ownership of the returned fd, and must close the returned
   * file descriptor when it is no longer needed.
   *
   * @param event An event that is backed by a sync fence.
   * @param sync_fence_fd The sync_fence file descriptor. The file descriptor
   * will be set to -1 if there is an error.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
   *
   * Available since API level 30.
