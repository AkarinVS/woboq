   * Set the maximum expected duration for compiling the model.
   *
   * If the device is not able to complete the compilation within the specified
   * duration, the compilation may be aborted. The timeout duration begins at
   * the call to {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation_finish}.
   *
   * This timeout duration acts as a hint to drivers, and can be used to both
   * free up compute resources within the driver and return control back to the
   * application quicker than is possible without the hint. It enables drivers
   * that are able to estimate how long a compilation will take to abort the
   * compilation before it has even started if the driver believes the
   * compilation cannot be completed within the timeout duration. Similarly, it
   * enables drivers to abort an ongoing compilation if it is taking too long.
   * However, this call does not guarantee that the compilation will complete or
   * abort within the timeout duration.
   *
   * By default (i.e., unless ANeuralNetworksCompilation_setTimeout is called),
   * the timeout duration for compiling the model is considered infinite.
   *
   * The {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation} must have been created with
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation_createForDevices} with numDevices = 1,
   * otherwise this function will fail with ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA. If the
   * device has a feature level reported by
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksDevice_getFeatureLevel} that is lower than 30, then
   * the timeout duration hint will be ignored.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * @param compilation The compilation to be modified.
   * @param duration The maximum amount of time in nanoseconds that is expected
   * to be spent finishing a compilation. If this duration is exceeded, the
   *     compilation may be aborted. If set to 0, the timeout duration is
   *     considered infinite.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
   *
   * Available since API level 30.
