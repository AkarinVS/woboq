<doc f='halide/build-apps/_deps/tflite-src/tensorflow/lite/c/common.h' l='856'>// This flag can be used by delegates (that allow dynamic tensors) to ensure
  // applicable tensor shapes are automatically propagated in the case of tensor
  // resizing.
  // This means that non-dynamic (allocation_type != kTfLiteDynamic) I/O tensors
  // of a delegate kernel will have correct shapes before its Prepare() method
  // is called. The runtime leverages TFLite builtin ops in the original
  // execution plan to propagate shapes.
  //
  // A few points to note:
  // 1. This requires kTfLiteDelegateFlagsAllowDynamicTensors. If that flag is
  // false, this one is redundant since the delegate kernels are re-initialized
  // every time tensors are resized.
  // 2. Enabling this flag adds some overhead to AllocateTensors(), since extra
  // work is required to prepare the original execution plan.
  // 3. This flag requires that the original execution plan only have ops with
  // valid registrations (and not &apos;dummy&apos; custom ops like with Flex).
  // WARNING: This feature is experimental and subject to change.</doc>
