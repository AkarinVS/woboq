   * Add an operand to a model.
   *
   * The order in which the operands are added is important. The first one added
   * to a model will have the index value 0, the second 1, etc. These indexes
   * are used as operand identifiers in
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_addOperation},
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setInput},
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setInputFromMemory},
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setOutput},
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setOutputFromMemory} and
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setOperandValue}.
   *
   * To build a model that can accommodate inputs of various sizes, as you may
   * want to do for a CNN, set the size of the dimensions that will vary at run
   * time to 0. If you do so, provide the full dimensions when calling
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_setInput} or {@link
   * ANeuralNetworksExecution_setInputFromMemory}.
   *
   * Attempting to modify a model once {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_finish} has
   * been called will return an error.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksModel} for information on multithreaded usage.
   *
   * @param model The model to be modified.
   * @param type The {@link ANeuralNetworksOperandType} that describes the shape
   * of the operand.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
