<doc f='halide/build-apps/eigen/Eigen/src/LU/FullPivLU.h' l='196'>/** \returns the image of the matrix, also called its column-space. The columns of the returned matrix
      * will form a basis of the image (column-space).
      *
      * \param originalMatrix the original matrix, of which *this is the LU decomposition.
      *                       The reason why it is needed to pass it here, is that this allows
      *                       a large optimization, as otherwise this method would need to reconstruct it
      *                       from the LU decomposition.
      *
      * \note If the image has dimension zero, then the returned matrix is a column-vector filled with zeros.
      *
      * \note This method has to determine which pivots should be considered nonzero.
      *       For that, it uses the threshold value that you can control by calling
      *       setThreshold(const RealScalar&amp;).
      *
      * Example: \include FullPivLU_image.cpp
      * Output: \verbinclude FullPivLU_image.out
