<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Passes/PassBuilder.h' l='388'>/// Build a pre-link, ThinLTO-targeting default optimization pipeline to
  /// a pass manager.
  ///
  /// This adds the pre-link optimizations tuned to prepare a module for
  /// a ThinLTO run. It works to minimize the IR which needs to be analyzed
  /// without making irreversible decisions which could be made better during
  /// the LTO run.
  ///
  /// Note that \p Level cannot be `O0` here. The pipelines produced are
  /// only intended for use when attempting to optimize code. If frontends
  /// require some transformations for semantic reasons, they should explicitly
  /// build them.</doc>
