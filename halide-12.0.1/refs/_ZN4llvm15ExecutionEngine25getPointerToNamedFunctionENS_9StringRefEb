<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/ExecutionEngine.h' l='229'>/// getPointerToNamedFunction - This method returns the address of the
  /// specified function by using the dlsym function call.  As such it is only
  /// useful for resolving library symbols, not code generated symbols.
  ///
  /// If AbortOnFailure is false and no function with the given name is
  /// found, this function silently returns a null pointer. Otherwise,
  /// it prints a message to stderr and aborts.

  /// This function is deprecated for the MCJIT execution engine.</doc>
