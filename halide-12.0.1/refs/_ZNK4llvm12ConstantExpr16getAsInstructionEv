  /// ConstantExpr. The instruction is not linked to any basic block.
  ///
  /// A better approach to this could be to have a constructor for Instruction
  /// which would take a ConstantExpr parameter, but that would have spread
  /// implementation details of ConstantExpr outside of Constants.cpp, which
  /// would make it harder to remove ConstantExprs altogether.</doc>
