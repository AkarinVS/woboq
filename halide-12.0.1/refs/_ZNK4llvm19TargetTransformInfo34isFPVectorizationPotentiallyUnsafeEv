<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Analysis/TargetTransformInfo.h' l='789'>/// Indicate that it is potentially unsafe to automatically vectorize
  /// floating-point operations because the semantics of vector and scalar
  /// floating-point semantics may differ. For example, ARM NEON v7 SIMD math
  /// does not support IEEE-754 denormal numbers, while depending on the
  /// platform, scalar floating-point math does.
  /// This applies to floating-point math operations and calls, not memory
  /// operations, shuffles, or casts.</doc>
