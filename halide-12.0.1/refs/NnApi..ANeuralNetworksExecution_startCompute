   * Schedule evaluation of the execution.
   *
   * &lt;p&gt;Schedules evaluation of the execution. Once the model has been
   * applied and the outputs are ready to be consumed, the execution will be
   * signaled. Use {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_wait} to wait for that
   * signal.
   * &lt;/p&gt;
   *
   * Multiple executions can be scheduled and evaluated concurrently, and
   * compilations can be performed concurrently with executions. The runtime
   * makes no guarantee on the ordering of the completion of compilations and
   * executions. If it&apos;s important to the application, the application should
   * enforce the ordering by using {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation_wait} and
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_wait}.
   *
   * ANeuralNetworksExecution_wait must be called to recuperate the resources
   * used by the execution.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * @param execution The execution to be scheduled and executed.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
