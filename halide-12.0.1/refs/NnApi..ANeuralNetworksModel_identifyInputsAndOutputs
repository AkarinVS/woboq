   * Specifies which operands will be the model&apos;s inputs and outputs.
   *
   * An operand cannot be used for both input and output. Doing so will
   * return an error.
   *
   * @param model The model to be modified.
   * @param inputCount The number of entries in the inputs array.
   * @param inputs An array of indexes identifying the input operands.
   * @param outputCount The number of entries in the outputs array.
   * @param outputs An array of indexes identifying the output operands.
   *
   * The operands specified by inputs and outputs must have been
   * previously added by calls to {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_addOperand}.
   *
   * Attempting to modify a model once {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_finish} has
   * been called will return an error.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksModel} for information on multithreaded usage.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
