   * Schedule synchronous evaluation of the execution on a burst object.
   *
   * &lt;p&gt;Schedules synchronous evaluation of the execution. Returns once the
   * execution has completed and the outputs are ready to be consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
   *
   * &lt;p&gt;There must be at most one {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} processing at
   * any given time for any given burst object. Any
   * {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} launched before the previous has finished
   * will result in ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_STATE.&lt;/p&gt;
   *
   * Available since API level 29.
   *
   * @param burst The burst object to execute on.
   * @param execution The execution to be scheduled and executed. The execution
   *                  must be created from the same {@link
   *                  ANeuralNetworksCompilation} as the burst object.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if the execution completed normally.
