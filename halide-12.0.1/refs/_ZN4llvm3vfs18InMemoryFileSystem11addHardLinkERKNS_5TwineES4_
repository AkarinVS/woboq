<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Support/VirtualFileSystem.h' l='446'>/// Add a hard link to a file.
  /// Here hard links are not intended to be fully equivalent to the classical
  /// filesystem. Both the hard link and the file share the same buffer and
  /// status (and thus have the same UniqueID). Because of this there is no way
  /// to distinguish between the link and the file after the link has been
  /// added.
  ///
  /// The To path must be an existing file or a hardlink. The From file must not
  /// have been added before. The To Path must not be a directory. The From Node
  /// is added as a hard link which points to the resolved file of To Node.
  /// \return true if the above condition is satisfied and hardlink was
  /// successfully created, false otherwise.</doc>
