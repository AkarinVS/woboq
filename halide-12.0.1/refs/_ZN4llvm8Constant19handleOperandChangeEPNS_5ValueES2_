  /// (which does not work on constants) that does work
  /// on constants.  Basically this method goes through the trouble of building
  /// a new constant that is equivalent to the current one, with all uses of
  /// From replaced with uses of To.  After this construction is completed, all
  /// of the users of &apos;this&apos; are replaced to use the new constant, and then
  /// &apos;this&apos; is deleted.  In general, you should not call this method, instead,
  /// use Value::replaceAllUsesWith, which automatically dispatches to this
