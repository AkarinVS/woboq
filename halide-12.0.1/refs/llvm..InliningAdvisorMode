<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/Analysis/InlineAdvisor.h' l='26'>/// There are 3 scenarios we can use the InlineAdvisor:
/// - Default - use manual heuristics.
///
/// - Release mode, the expected mode for production, day to day deployments.
/// In this mode, when building the compiler, we also compile a pre-trained ML
/// model to native code, and link it as a static library. This mode has low
/// overhead and no additional dependencies for the compiler runtime.
///
/// - Development mode, for training new models.
/// In this mode, we trade off runtime performance for flexibility. This mode
/// requires the full C Tensorflow API library, and evaluates models
/// dynamically. This mode also permits generating training logs, for offline
/// training.</doc>
