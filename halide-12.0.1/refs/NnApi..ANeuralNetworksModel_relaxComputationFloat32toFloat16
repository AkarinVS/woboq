   * Specifies whether {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_FLOAT32} is allowed to be
   * calculated with range and/or precision as low as that of the
   * IEEE 754 16-bit floating-point format. By default,
   * {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_FLOAT32} must be calculated using at least
   * the range and precision of the IEEE 754 32-bit floating-point format.
   *
   * @param model The model to be modified.
   * @param allow &apos;true&apos; indicates {@link ANEURALNETWORKS_TENSOR_FLOAT32} may be
   *              calculated with range and/or precision as low as that of the

   *
   * Attempting to modify a model once {@link ANeuralNetworksModel_finish} has
   * been called will return an error.
   *
   * Available since API level 28.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksModel} for information on multithreaded usage.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
