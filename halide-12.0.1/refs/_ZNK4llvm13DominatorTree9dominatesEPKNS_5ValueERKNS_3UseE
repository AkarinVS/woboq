  /// available at U, and could be substituted as the used value without
  /// violating the SSA dominance requirement.
  ///
  /// In particular, it is worth noting that:
  ///  * Non-instruction Defs dominate everything.
  ///  * Def does not dominate a use in Def itself (outside of degenerate cases
  ///    like unreachable code or trivial phi cycles).
  ///  * Invoke/callbr Defs only dominate uses in their default destination.</doc>
