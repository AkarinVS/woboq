<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/IR/PassManager.h' l='392'>/// Returns an opaque, unique ID for this analysis type.
  ///
  /// This ID is a pointer type that is guaranteed to be 8-byte aligned and thus
  /// suitable for use in sets, maps, and other data structures that use the low
  /// bits of pointers.
  ///
  /// Note that this requires the derived type provide a static \c AnalysisKey
  /// member called \c Key.
  ///
  /// FIXME: The only reason the mixin type itself can&apos;t declare the Key value
  /// is that some compilers cannot correctly unique a templated static variable
  /// so it has the same addresses in each instantiation. The only currently
  /// known platform with this limitation is Windows DLL builds, specifically
  /// building each part of LLVM as a DLL. If we ever remove that build
  /// configuration, this mixin can provide the static key as well.</doc>
