   * Sets the compilation caching signature and the cache directory.
   *
   * Provides optional caching information to the runtime for faster repeated
   * compilation.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksCompilation} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * @param compilation The compilation to be modified.
   * @param cacheDir The cache directory to store and retrieve caching data. It
   *                 is recommended to use the code_cache provided by the
   *                 Android runtime. If not using the code_cache, the user
   *                 should choose a directory local to the application, and is
   *                 responsible to manage and clean the cache entries.
   * @param token The token provided by the user to specify a model, must be of
   *              length ANEURALNETWORKS_BYTE_SIZE_OF_CACHE_TOKEN. The user
   *              should ensure that the token is unique to a model within the
   *              application. The NNAPI runtime will not detected token
   *              collisions. If there is a collision, the compilation outcome
   *              may be incorrect without notifying with error.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if successful.
   *
   * Available since API level 29.
