<doc f='halide/llvm-install/include/llvm/IR/Value.h' l='447'>/// Return true if there is exactly one user of this value.
  ///
  /// Note that this is not the same as &quot;has one use&quot;. If a value has one use,
  /// then there certainly is a single user. But if value has several uses,
  /// it is possible that all uses are in a single user, or not.
  ///
  /// This check is potentially costly, since it requires traversing,
  /// in the worst case, the whole use list of a value.</doc>
