 * Type-oriented memory interface

 *
 * Allocate memory for n objects of the given type.  Returns a new pointer
 * or NULL if the request was too large or memory allocation failed.  Use
 * these macros rather than doing the multiplication yourself so that proper
 * overflow checking is always done.
