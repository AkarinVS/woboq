<doc f='include/python3.8/pythread.h' l='40'>/* PY_TIMEOUT_T is the integral type used to specify timeouts when waiting
   on a lock (see PyThread_acquire_lock_timed() below).
   PY_TIMEOUT_MAX is the highest usable value (in microseconds) of that
   type, and depends on the system threading API.

   NOTE: this isn&apos;t the same value as `_thread.TIMEOUT_MAX`.  The _thread
   module exposes a higher-level API, with timeouts expressed in seconds
   and floating-point numbers allowed.
