   * Schedule synchronous evaluation of the execution.
   *
   * &lt;p&gt;Schedules synchronous evaluation of the execution. Returns once the
   * execution has completed and the outputs are ready to be consumed.
   * &lt;/p&gt;
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution} for information on multithreaded
   * usage.
   *
   * See {@link ANeuralNetworksExecution_startCompute} for asynchronous
   * execution. Synchronous execution incurs lower overhead than asynchronous
   * execution.
   *
   * Available since API level 29.
   *
   * @param execution The execution to be scheduled and executed.
   *
   * @return ANEURALNETWORKS_NO_ERROR if the execution completed normally.
   *         ANEURALNETWORKS_UNMAPPABLE if the execution input or output memory
   *         cannot be properly mapped.
