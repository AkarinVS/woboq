  /// be able to release its memory when it is no longer needed.  The default
  /// behavior of passes is to hold onto memory for the entire duration of their
  /// lifetime (which is the entire compile time).  For pipelined passes, this
  /// is not a big deal because that memory gets recycled every time the pass is
  /// invoked on another program unit.  For IP passes, it is more important to
  /// free memory when it is unused.
