 *
 * In particular, insert a context node, create kernels for
 * each outermost tilable band and introduce nodes for copying arrays
 * in and out of the device and for initializing and clearing the device.
 * If the child of the initial root points to a set node,
 * then children of this node that do not contain any tilable bands
 * are separated from the other children and are not mapped to
 * the device.
 *
 * The GPU code is generated in a context where at least one
 * statement instance is executed.  The corresponding guard is inserted
 * around the entire schedule.
