    // is non-NULL only if the data remains bound to the object in some
    // way, such that the object must be &quot;released&quot; (via a decref) when
    // the data is released.  In that case the code that sets the field,
    // likely a registered &quot;crossinterpdatafunc&quot;, is responsible for
    // ensuring it owns the reference (i.e. incref).</doc>
