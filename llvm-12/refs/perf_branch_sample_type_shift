 * values to program into branch_sample_type when PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH is set
 *
 * If the user does not pass priv level information via branch_sample_type,
 * the kernel uses the event&apos;s priv level. Branch and event priv levels do
 * not have to match. Branch priv level is checked for permissions.
 *
 * The branch types can be combined, however BRANCH_ANY covers all types
 * of branches and therefore it supersedes all the other types.
