<doc f='llvm/llvm/utils/TableGen/GlobalISel/GIMatchTree.h' l='459'>/// Determines which partitions the given leaves belong to. A leaf may belong
  /// to multiple partitions in which case it will be duplicated during
  /// applyForPartition().
  ///
  /// This function can be rather complicated. A few particular things to be
  /// aware of include:
  /// * One leaf can be assigned to multiple partitions when there&apos;s some
  ///   ambiguity.
  /// * Not all DAG&apos;s for the leaves may be able to perform the test. For
  ///   example, the opcode partitiioner must account for one DAG being a
  ///   superset of another such as [(ADD ..., ..., ...)], and [(MUL t, ...,
  ///   ...), (ADD ..., t, ...)]
  /// * Attaching meaning to a particular partition index will generally not
  ///   work due to the &apos;0, 1, ..., n&apos; requirement. You might encounter cases
  ///   where only partition 1 is seen, leaving a missing 0.
  /// * Finding a specific predicate such as the opcode predicate for a specific
  ///   instruction is non-trivial. It&apos;s often O(NumPredicates), leading to
  ///   O(NumPredicates*NumRules) when applied to the whole ruleset. The good
  ///   news there is that n is typically small thanks to predicate dependencies
  ///   limiting how many are testable at once. Also, with opcode and type
  ///   predicates being so frequent the value of m drops very fast too. It
  ///   wouldn&apos;t be terribly surprising to see a 10k ruleset drop down to an
  ///   average of 100 leaves per partition after a single opcode partitioner.
  /// * The same goes for finding specific edges. The need to traverse them in
  ///   dependency order dramatically limits the search space at any given
  ///   moment.
  /// * If you need to add a leaf to all partitions, make sure you don&apos;t forget
  ///   them when adding partitions later.</doc>
