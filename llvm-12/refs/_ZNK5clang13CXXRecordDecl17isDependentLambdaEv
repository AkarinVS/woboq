  ///
  /// This flag is a workaround for an issue with parsing, where default
  /// arguments are parsed before their enclosing function declarations have
  /// been created. This means that any lambda expressions within those
  /// default arguments will have as their DeclContext the context enclosing
  /// the function declaration, which may be non-dependent even when the
  /// function declaration itself is dependent. This flag indicates when we
  /// know that the lambda is dependent despite that.</doc>
