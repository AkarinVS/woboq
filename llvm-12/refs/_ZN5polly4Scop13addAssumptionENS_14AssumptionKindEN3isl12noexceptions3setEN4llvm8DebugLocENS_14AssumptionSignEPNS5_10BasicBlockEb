  /// The assumptions added will be assumed to hold during the execution of the
  /// scop. However, as they are generally not statically provable, at code
  /// generation time run-time checks will be generated that ensure the
  /// assumptions hold.
  ///
  /// WARNING: We currently exploit in simplifyAssumedContext the knowledge
  ///          that assumptions do not change the set of statement instances
  ///          executed.
  ///
  /// @param Kind The assumption kind describing the underlying cause.
  /// @param Set  The relations between parameters that are assumed to hold.
  /// @param Loc  The location in the source that caused this assumption.
  /// @param Sign Enum to indicate if the assumptions in @p Set are positive
  ///             (needed/assumptions) or negative (invalid/restrictions).
  /// @param BB   The block in which this assumption was taken. Used to
  ///             calculate hotness when emitting remark.
  /// @param RTC  Does the assumption require a runtime check?</doc>
