<doc f='llvm/polly/include/polly/CodeGen/IslNodeBuilder.h' l='346'>/// Generate LLVM-IR that computes the values of the original induction
  /// variables in function of the newly generated loop induction variables.
  ///
  /// Example:
  ///
  ///   // Original
  ///   for i
  ///     for j
  ///       S(i)
  ///
  ///   Schedule: [i,j] -&gt; [i+j, j]
  ///
  ///   // New
  ///   for c0
  ///     for c1
  ///       S(c0 - c1, c1)
  ///
  /// Assuming the original code consists of two loops which are
  /// transformed according to a schedule [i,j] -&gt; [c0=i+j,c1=j]. The resulting
  /// ast models the original statement as a call expression where each argument
  /// is an expression that computes the old induction variables from the new
  /// ones, ordered such that the first argument computes the value of induction
  /// variable that was outermost in the original code.
  ///
  /// @param Expr The call expression that represents the statement.
  /// @param Stmt The statement that is called.
  /// @param LTS  The loop to SCEV map in which the mapping from the original
  ///             loop to a SCEV representing the new loop iv is added. This
  ///             mapping does not require an explicit induction variable.
  ///             Instead, we think in terms of an implicit induction variable
  ///             that counts the number of times a loop is executed. For each
  ///             original loop this count, expressed in function of the new
  ///             induction variables, is added to the LTS map.</doc>
