 *
 * &quot;schedule&quot; is the schedule that the node is pointing to.
 * &quot;ancestors&quot; is a list of the n ancestors of the node
 * that is being pointed to.
 * The first ancestor is the root of &quot;schedule&quot;, while the last ancestor
 * is the parent of the specified location.
 * &quot;child_pos&quot; is an array of child positions of the same length as &quot;ancestors&quot;,
 * where ancestor i (i &gt; 0) appears in child_pos[i - 1] of ancestor i - 1 and
 * &quot;tree&quot; appears in child_pos[n - 1] of ancestor n - 1.
 * &quot;tree&quot; is the subtree at the specified location.
 *
 * Note that the same isl_schedule_tree object may appear several times
 * in a schedule tree and therefore does not uniquely identify a position
 * in the schedule tree.
