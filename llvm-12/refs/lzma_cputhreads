 * \brief       Get the number of processor cores or threads
 *
 * This function may be useful when determining how many threads to use.
 * If the hardware supports more than one thread per CPU core, the number

 *
 * \brief       On success, the number of available CPU threads or cores is
 *              returned. If this information isn&apos;t available or an error
