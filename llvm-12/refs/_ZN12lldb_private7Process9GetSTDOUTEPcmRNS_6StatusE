  /// Calling this method is a valid operation only if all of the following
  /// conditions are true: 1) The process was launched, and not attached to.
  /// 2) The process was not launched with eLaunchFlagDisableSTDIO. 3) The
  /// process was launched without supplying a valid file path
  ///    for STDOUT.
  ///
  /// Note that the implementation will probably need to start a read thread
  /// in the background to make sure that the pipe is drained and the STDOUT
  /// buffered appropriately, to prevent the process from deadlocking trying
  /// to write to a full buffer.
  ///
  /// Events will be queued indicating that there is STDOUT available that can
  /// be retrieved using this function.
  ///
  /// \param[out] buf
  ///     A buffer that will receive any STDOUT bytes that are
  ///     currently available.
  ///
  /// \param[in] buf_size
  ///     The size in bytes for the buffer \a buf.
  ///
  /// \return
  ///     The number of bytes written into \a buf. If this value is
  ///     equal to \a buf_size, another call to this function should
  ///     be made to retrieve more STDOUT data.</doc>
