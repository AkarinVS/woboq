  /// suspended with
  /// this API, it won&apos;t take part in any of the arbitration for ShouldResume,
  /// and will stay
  /// suspended even when other threads do get to run.
  ///
  /// N.B. This is not the state that is used internally by thread plans to
  /// implement
  /// staying on one thread while stepping over a breakpoint, etc.  The is the
  /// TemporaryResume state, and if you are implementing some bit of strategy in

  /// machinery you should be using that state and not the user resume state.
  ///
  /// If you are just preparing all threads to run, you should not override the
  /// threads that are

  /// = false.  If you want
  /// to force the thread to run (e.g. the &quot;thread continue&quot; command, or are
