<doc f='llvm/polly/include/polly/CodeGen/PerfMonitor.h' l='96'>/// Get a reference to the intrinsic &quot;{ i64, i32 } @llvm.x86.rdtscp()&quot;.
  ///
  /// The rdtscp function returns the current value of the processor&apos;s
  /// time-stamp counter as well as the current CPU identifier. On modern x86
  /// systems, the returned value is independent of the dynamic clock frequency
  /// and consistent across multiple cores. It can consequently be used to get
  /// accurate and low-overhead timing information. Even though the counter is
  /// wrapping, it can be reliably used even for measuring longer time
  /// intervals, as on a 1 GHz processor the counter only wraps every 545 years.
  ///
  /// The RDTSCP instruction is &quot;pseudo&quot; serializing:
  ///
  /// &quot;“The RDTSCP instruction waits until all previous instructions have been
  /// executed before reading the counter. However, subsequent instructions may
  /// begin execution before the read operation is performed.”
  ///
  /// To ensure that no later instructions are scheduled before the RDTSCP
  /// instruction it is often recommended to schedule a cpuid call after the
  /// RDTSCP instruction. We do not do this yet, trading some imprecision in
  /// our timing for a reduced overhead in our timing.
  ///
  /// @returns A reference to the declaration of @llvm.x86.rdtscp.</doc>
