 * \brief       Set the memory usage limit
 *
 * This function is supported only when *strm has been initialized with
 * a function that takes a memlimit argument.
 *
 * liblzma 5.2.3 and earlier has a bug where memlimit value of 0 causes
 * this function to do nothing (leaving the limit unchanged) and still
 * return LZMA_OK. Later versions treat 0 as if 1 had been specified (so
 * lzma_memlimit_get() will return 1 even if you specify 0 here).
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: New memory usage limit successfully set.
 *              - LZMA_MEMLIMIT_ERROR: The new limit is too small.
 *                The limit was not changed.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR: Invalid arguments, e.g. *strm doesn&apos;t
 *                support memory usage limit.
