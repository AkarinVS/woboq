		 * \brief       Input stream has no integrity check
		 *
		 * This return value can be returned only if the
		 * LZMA_TELL_NO_CHECK flag was used when initializing
		 * the decoder. LZMA_NO_CHECK is just a warning, and
		 * the decoding can be continued normally.
		 *
		 * It is possible to call lzma_get_check() immediately after
		 * lzma_code has returned LZMA_NO_CHECK. The result will
		 * naturally be LZMA_CHECK_NONE, but the possibility to call
		 * lzma_get_check() may be convenient in some applications.
