 *
 * &quot;build&quot; is the build in which the unrolling will be performed
 * &quot;domain&quot; is the original set for which to find a lower bound
 * &quot;depth&quot; is the dimension for which to find a lower boudn
 * &quot;expansion&quot; is the expansion that needs to be applied to &quot;domain&quot;
 * in the unrolling that will be performed
 *
 * &quot;lower&quot; is the best lower bound found so far.  It is NULL if we have not
 * found any yet.
 * &quot;n&quot; is the corresponding size.  If lower is NULL, then the value of n
 * is undefined.
 * &quot;n_div&quot; is the maximal number of integer divisions in the first
 * unrolled iteration (after expansion).  It is set to -1 if it hasn&apos;t
 * been computed yet.
