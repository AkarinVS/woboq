<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/MCA/HardwareUnits/ResourceManager.h' l='97'>/// This field is used to track resource units that are used (i.e. selected)
  /// by other groups other than the one associated with this strategy object.
  ///
  /// In LLVM processor resource groups are allowed to partially (or fully)
  /// overlap. That means, a same unit may be visible to multiple groups.
  /// This field keeps track of uses that have originated from outside of
  /// this group. The idea is to bias the selection strategy, so that resources
  /// that haven&apos;t been used by other groups get prioritized.
  ///
  /// The end goal is to (try to) keep the resource distribution as much uniform
  /// as possible. By construction, this mask only tracks one-level of resource
  /// usage. Therefore, this strategy is expected to be less accurate when same
  /// units are used multiple times by other groups within a single round of
  /// select.
  ///
  /// Note: an LRU selector would have a better accuracy at the cost of being
  /// slightly more expensive (mostly in terms of runtime cost). Methods
  /// &apos;select&apos; and &apos;used&apos;, are always in the hot execution path of llvm-mca.
  /// Therefore, a slow implementation of &apos;select&apos; would have a negative impact
  /// on the overall performance of the tool.</doc>
