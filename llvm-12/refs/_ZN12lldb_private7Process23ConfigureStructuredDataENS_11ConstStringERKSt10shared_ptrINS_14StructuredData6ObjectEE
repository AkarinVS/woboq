  ///
  /// Each Process type that supports using an asynchronous StructuredData
  /// feature should implement this to enable/disable/configure the feature.
  /// The default implementation here will always return an error indiciating
  /// the feature is unsupported.
  ///
  /// StructuredDataPlugin implementations will call this to configure a
  /// feature that has been reported as being supported.
  ///
  /// \param[in] type_name
  ///     The StructuredData type name as previously discovered by
  ///     the Process-derived instance.
  ///
  /// \param[in] config_sp
  ///     Configuration data for the feature being enabled.  This config
  ///     data, which may be null, will be passed along to the feature
  ///     to process.  The feature will dictate whether this is a dictionary,
  ///     an array or some other object.  If the feature needs to be
  ///     set up properly before it can be enabled, then the config should
  ///     also take an enable/disable flag.
  ///
  /// \return
  ///     Returns the result of attempting to configure the feature.</doc>
