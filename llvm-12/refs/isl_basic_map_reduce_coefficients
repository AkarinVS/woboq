<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_map_simplify.c' l='5379'>/* If &quot;bmap&quot; is an integer set that satisfies any equality involving
 * more than 2 variables and/or has coefficients different from -1 and 1,
 * then use variable compression to reduce the coefficients by removing
 * any (hidden) common factor.
 * In particular, apply the variable compression to each constraint,
 * factor out any common factor in the non-constant coefficients and
 * then apply the inverse of the compression.
 * At the end, we mark the basic map as having reduced constants.
 * If this flag is still set on the next invocation of this function,
 * then we skip the computation.
 *
 * Removing a common factor may result in a tightening of some of
 * the constraints.  If this happens, then we may end up with two
 * opposite inequalities that can be replaced by an equality.
 * We therefore call isl_basic_map_detect_inequality_pairs,
 * which checks for such pairs of inequalities as well as eliminate_divs_eq
 * and isl_basic_map_gauss if such a pair was found.
 *
 * Tightening may also result in some other constraints becoming
 * (rationally) redundant with respect to the tightened constraint
 * (in combination with other constraints).  The basic map may
 * therefore no longer be assumed to have no redundant constraints.
 *
 * Note that this function may leave the result in an inconsistent state.
 * In particular, the constraints may not be gaussed.
 * Unfortunately, isl_map_coalesce actually depends on this inconsistent state
 * for some of the test cases to pass successfully.
 * Any potential modification of the representation is therefore only
 * performed on a single copy of the basic map.
