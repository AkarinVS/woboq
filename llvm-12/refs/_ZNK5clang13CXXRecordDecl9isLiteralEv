  ///
  /// C++11 [basic.types]p10:
  ///   A class type that has all the following properties:
  ///     - it has a trivial destructor
  ///     - every constructor call and full-expression in the
  ///       brace-or-equal-intializers for non-static data members (if any) is
  ///       a constant expression.
  ///     - it is an aggregate type or has at least one constexpr constructor
  ///       or constructor template that is not a copy or move constructor, and
  ///     - all of its non-static data members and base classes are of literal
  ///       types
  ///
  /// We resolve DR1361 by ignoring the second bullet. We resolve DR1452 by
  /// treating types with trivial default constructors as literal types.
  ///
  /// Only in C++17 and beyond, are lambdas literal types.</doc>
