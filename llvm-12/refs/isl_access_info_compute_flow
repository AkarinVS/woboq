<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_flow.c' l='1354'>/* Given a &quot;sink&quot; access, a list of n &quot;source&quot; accesses,
 * compute for each iteration of the sink access
 * and for each element accessed by that iteration,
 * the source access in the list that last accessed the
 * element accessed by the sink access before this sink access.
 * Each access is given as a map from the loop iterators
 * to the array indices.
 * The result is a list of n relations between source and sink
 * iterations and a subset of the domain of the sink access,
 * corresponding to those iterations that access an element
 * not previously accessed.
 *
 * To deal with multi-valued sink access relations,
 * access_info_compute_flow_core extends the sink iteration domain
 * with dimensions that correspond to the data space.  These extra dimensions
 * are projected out from the result of access_info_compute_flow_core.
