 * \brief       Single-call uncompressed .xz Block encoder
 *
 * This is like lzma_block_buffer_encode() except this doesn&apos;t try to
 * compress the data and instead encodes the data using LZMA2 uncompressed
 * chunks. The required output buffer size can be determined with
 * lzma_block_buffer_bound().
 *
 * Since the data won&apos;t be compressed, this function ignores block-&gt;filters.
 * This function doesn&apos;t take lzma_allocator because this function doesn&apos;t
 * allocate any memory from the heap.
