<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/MCA/HWEventListener.h' l='29'>// This is the list of event types that are shared by all targets, that
  // generic subtarget-agnostic classes (e.g., Pipeline, HWInstructionEvent,
  // ...) and generic Views can manipulate.
  // Subtargets are free to define additional event types, that are goin to be
  // handled by generic components as opaque values, but can still be
  // emitted by subtarget-specific pipeline stages (e.g., ExecuteStage,
  // DispatchStage, ...) and interpreted by subtarget-specific EventListener
