  ///  If a diagnostic is already in-flight but the front end must

  ///  state), this routine sets a &quot;delayed&quot; diagnostic that will be
  ///  emitted after the current diagnostic completes. This should

  ///  times. If emitting a delayed diagnostic causes a second delayed
  ///  diagnostic to be introduced, that second delayed diagnostic
  ///  will be ignored.
  ///
  /// \param DiagID The ID of the diagnostic being delayed.
  ///
  /// \param Arg1 A string argument that will be provided to the
