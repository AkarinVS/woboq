<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_ast_graft.c' l='181'>/* Extract a common guard from the grafts in &quot;list&quot; that can be hoisted
 * out of the current level.  If no such guard can be found, then return
 * a universal set.
 *
 * If all the grafts in the list have the same guard and if this guard
 * is independent of the current level, then it can be hoisted out.
 * If there is only one graft in the list and if its guard
 * depends on the current level, then we eliminate this level and
 * return the result.
 *
 * Otherwise, we return the unshifted simple hull of the guards.
 * In order to be able to hoist as many constraints as possible,
 * but at the same time avoid hoisting constraints that did not
 * appear in the guards in the first place, we intersect the guards
 * with all the information that is available (i.e., the domain
 * from the build and the enforced constraints of the graft) and
 * compute the unshifted hull of the result using only constraints
 * from the original guards.
 * In particular, intersecting the guards with other known information
 * allows us to hoist guards that are only explicit is some of
 * the grafts and implicit in the others.
 *
 * The special case for equal guards is needed in case those guards
 * are non-convex.  Taking the simple hull would remove information
 * and would not allow for these guards to be hoisted completely.
