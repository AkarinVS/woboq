 * Clear all unreferenced symbol string pool entries.

 * This can be called at any time to release unused entries in the
 * ExecutionSession&apos;s string pool. Since it locks the pool (preventing
 * interning of any new strings) it is recommended that it only be called
 * infrequently, ideally when the caller has reason to believe that some
 * entries will have become unreferenced, e.g. after removing a module or
 * closing a JITDylib.
