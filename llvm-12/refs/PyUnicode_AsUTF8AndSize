<doc f='include/python3.8/cpython/unicodeobject.h' l='737'>/* Returns a pointer to the default encoding (UTF-8) of the
   Unicode object unicode and the size of the encoded representation
   in bytes stored in *size.

   In case of an error, no *size is set.

   This function caches the UTF-8 encoded string in the unicodeobject
   and subsequent calls will return the same string.  The memory is released
   when the unicodeobject is deallocated.

   _PyUnicode_AsStringAndSize is a #define for PyUnicode_AsUTF8AndSize to
   support the previous internal function with the same behaviour.

   *** This API is for interpreter INTERNAL USE ONLY and will likely
   *** be removed or changed in the future.

   *** If you need to access the Unicode object as UTF-8 bytes string,
   *** please use PyUnicode_AsUTF8String() instead.
