<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_schedule_node.c' l='2016'>/* Move the band node &quot;node&quot; down to all the leaves in the subtree
 * rooted at &quot;node&quot;.
 * Return a pointer to the node in the resulting tree that is in the same
 * position as the node pointed to by &quot;node&quot; in the original tree.
 *
 * If the node only has a leaf child, then nothing needs to be done.
 * Otherwise, the child of the node is removed and the result is
 * appended to all the leaves in the subtree rooted at the original child.
 * Since the node is moved to the leaves, it needs to be expanded
 * according to the expansion, if any, defined by that subtree.
 * In the end, the original node is replaced by the result of
 * attaching copies of the expanded node to the leaves.
 *
 * If any of the nodes in the subtree rooted at &quot;node&quot; depend on
 * the set of outer band nodes then we refuse to sink the band node.
