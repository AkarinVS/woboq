<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/imath/imrat.h' l='188'>/** Converts the value of `r` to a string in decimal-point notation with the
    specified radix, writing no more than `limit` bytes of data to the given
    output buffer.  It generates `prec` digits of precision, and requires
    `MP_MIN_RADIX &lt;= radix &lt;= MP_MAX_RADIX`.

    Ratios usually must be rounded when they are being converted for output as
    a decimal value.  There are four rounding modes currently supported:

      MP_ROUND_DOWN
        Truncates the value toward zero.
        Example:  12.009 to 2dp becomes 12.00

      MP_ROUND_UP
        Rounds the value away from zero:
        Example:  12.001 to 2dp becomes 12.01, but
                  12.000 to 2dp remains 12.00

      MP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN
         Rounds the value to nearest digit, half goes toward zero.
         Example:  12.005 to 2dp becomes 12.00, but
                   12.006 to 2dp becomes 12.01

      MP_ROUND_HALF_UP
         Rounds the value to nearest digit, half rounds upward.
         Example:  12.005 to 2dp becomes 12.01, but
                   12.004 to 2dp becomes 12.00
