		 *
		 * This value can be returned only by the lzma_code() function
		 * and only if the decoder was initialized with the
		 * LZMA_TELL_ANY_CHECK flag. LZMA_GET_CHECK tells the
		 * application that it may now call lzma_get_check() to find
		 * out the Check ID. This can be used, for example, to
		 * implement a decoder that accepts only files that have
		 * strong enough integrity check.
