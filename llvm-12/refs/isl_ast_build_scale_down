 * &quot;umap&quot; is an isl_union_map that implements the scaling down.
 * That is, it is of the form
 *
 *	{ [.... i ....] -&gt; [.... i&apos; ....] : i = m i&apos; }
 *
 * This function is called right after the strides have been
 * detected, but before any constraints on the current dimension
 * have been included in build-&gt;domain.
 * We therefore only need to update stride, offset, the options and
 * the mapping from internal schedule space to the original schedule
 * space, if we are still keeping track of such a mapping.
 * The latter mapping is updated by plugging in
 * { [... i ...] -&gt; [... m i ... ] }.
