<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_map_simplify.c' l='577'>/* Perform fangcheng (Gaussian elimination) on the equality
 * constraints of &quot;bmap&quot;.
 * That is, put them into row-echelon form, starting from the last column
 * backward and use them to eliminate the corresponding coefficients
 * from all constraints.
 *
 * If &quot;progress&quot; is not NULL, then it gets set if the elimination
 * results in any changes.
 * The elimination process may result in some equality constraints
 * getting interchanged or removed.
 * If &quot;swap&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; are not NULL, then they get called when
 * two equality constraints get interchanged or
 * when a number of final equality constraints get removed.
 * As a special case, if the input turns out to be empty,
 * then drop gets called with the number of removed equality
 * constraints set to the total number of equality constraints.
 * If &quot;swap&quot; or &quot;drop&quot; are not NULL, then the local variables (if any)
 * are assumed to be in a valid order.
