 * \brief       LZMA1 Filter ID
 *
 * LZMA1 is the very same thing as what was called just LZMA in LZMA Utils,
 * 7-Zip, and LZMA SDK. It&apos;s called LZMA1 here to prevent developers from
 * accidentally using LZMA when they actually want LZMA2.
 *
 * LZMA1 shouldn&apos;t be used for new applications unless you _really_ know
 * what you are doing. LZMA2 is almost always a better choice.
