 * el_set/el_get parameters
 *
 * When using el_wset/el_wget (as opposed to el_set/el_get):
 *   Char is wchar_t, otherwise it is char.
 *   prompt_func is el_wpfunc_t, otherwise it is el_pfunc_t .

 * Prompt function prototypes are:
 *   typedef char    *(*el_pfunct_t)  (EditLine *);
 *   typedef wchar_t *(*el_wpfunct_t) (EditLine *);
 *
 * For operations that support set or set/get, the argument types listed are for
 * the &quot;set&quot; operation. For &quot;get&quot;, each listed type must be a pointer.
 * E.g. EL_EDITMODE takes an int when set, but an int* when get.
 *
 * Operations that only support &quot;get&quot; have the correct argument types listed.
