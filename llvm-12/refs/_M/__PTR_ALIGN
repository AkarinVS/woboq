   where pointers can be converted to integers, aligned as integers,
   and converted back again.  If PTR_INT_TYPE is narrower than a
   pointer (e.g., the AS/400), play it safe and compute the alignment
   relative to B.  Otherwise, use the faster strategy of computing the
   alignment relative to 0.  */</doc>
