 * This flag makes lzma_code() not calculate and verify the integrity check
 * of the compressed data in .xz files. This means that invalid integrity
 * check values won&apos;t be detected and LZMA_DATA_ERROR won&apos;t be returned in
 * such cases.
 *
 * This flag only affects the checks of the compressed data itself; the CRC32
 * values in the .xz headers will still be verified normally.
 *
 * Don&apos;t use this flag unless you know what you are doing. Possible reasons
 * to use this flag:
 *
 *   - Trying to recover data from a corrupt .xz file.
 *
 *   - Speeding up decompression, which matters mostly with SHA-256
 *     or with files that have compressed extremely well. It&apos;s recommended
 *     to not use this flag for this purpose unless the file integrity is
 *     verified externally in some other way.
 *
 * Support for this flag was added in liblzma 5.1.4beta.
