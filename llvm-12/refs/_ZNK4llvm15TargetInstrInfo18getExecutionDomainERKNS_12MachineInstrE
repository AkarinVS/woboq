<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/CodeGen/TargetInstrInfo.h' l='1622'>/// Return the current execution domain and bit mask of
  /// possible domains for instruction.
  ///
  /// Some micro-architectures have multiple execution domains, and multiple
  /// opcodes that perform the same operation in different domains.  For
  /// example, the x86 architecture provides the por, orps, and orpd
  /// instructions that all do the same thing.  There is a latency penalty if a
  /// register is written in one domain and read in another.
  ///
  /// This function returns a pair (domain, mask) containing the execution
  /// domain of MI, and a bit mask of possible domains.  The setExecutionDomain
  /// function can be used to change the opcode to one of the domains in the
  /// bit mask.  Instructions whose execution domain can&apos;t be changed should
  /// return a 0 mask.
  ///
  /// The execution domain numbers don&apos;t have any special meaning except domain
  /// 0 is used for instructions that are not associated with any interesting
  /// execution domain.
