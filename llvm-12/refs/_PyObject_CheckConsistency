<doc f='include/python3.8/cpython/object.h' l='453'>/* Check if an object is consistent. For example, ensure that the reference
   counter is greater than or equal to 1, and ensure that ob_type is not NULL.

   Call _PyObject_AssertFailed() if the object is inconsistent.

   If check_content is zero, only check header fields: reduce the overhead.

   The function always return 1. The return value is just here to be able to
   write:

   assert(_PyObject_CheckConsistency(obj, 1)); */</doc>
