 * This variable is defined in InstrProfiling.c. Its main purpose is to
 * encode the raw profile version value and other format related information
 * such as whether the profile is from IR based instrumentation. The variable
 * is defined as weak so that compiler can emit an overriding definition
 * depending on user option.  Since we don&apos;t support mixing FE and IR based
 * data in the same raw profile data file (in other words, shared libs and
 * main program are expected to be instrumented in the same way), there is
 * no need for this variable to be hidden.
