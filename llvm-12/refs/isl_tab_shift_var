 * If the variable is in a column, then we first check if we can
 * simply plug in v = v&apos; - shift.  The effect on a row with
 * coefficient f/d for variable v is that the constant term c/d
 * is replaced by (c - f * shift)/d.  If shift is positive and
 * f is negative for each row that needs to remain non-negative,
 * then this is clearly safe.  In other words, if the minimum of v
 * is manifestly unbounded, then we can keep v in a column position.
 * Otherwise, we can pivot it down to a row.
 * Similarly, if shift is negative, we need to check if the maximum
 * of is manifestly unbounded.
 *
 * If the variable is in a row (from the start or after pivoting),
 * then the constant term c/d is replaced by (c + d * shift)/d.
