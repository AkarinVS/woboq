<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/imath/imath.h' l='393'>/** Converts the magnitude of `z` to unsigned binary, writing at most `limit`
    bytes into the given `buf`.  The sign of `z` is ignored, but `z` is not
    modified.  Returns `MP_TRUNC` if the buffer limit was too small to contain
    the whole value.  If this occurs, the contents of `buf` will be effectively
    garbage, as the function uses the buffer as scratch space during
    conversion.

    The binary representation of `z` is in base-256 with digits ordered from
    most significant to least significant (network byte ordering). */</doc>
