<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/MCA/HardwareUnits/ResourceManager.h' l='180'>/// Buffered resources will have this field set to a positive number different

  ///
  /// A BufferSize of 1 is used by scheduler resources that force in-order
  /// execution.
  ///
  /// A BufferSize of 0 is used to model in-order issue/dispatch resources.
  /// Since in-order issue/dispatch resources don&apos;t implement buffers, dispatch
  /// events coincide with issue events.
  /// Also, no other instruction ca be dispatched/issue while this resource is
  /// in use. Only when all the &quot;resource cycles&quot; are consumed (after the issue
  /// event), a new instruction ca be dispatched.</doc>
