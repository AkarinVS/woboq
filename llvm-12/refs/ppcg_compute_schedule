 * constraints in &quot;sc&quot;.
 *
 * &quot;schedule&quot; is a known correct schedule that is used to combine
 * groups of statements if options-&gt;group_chains is set.
 * In particular, statements that are executed consecutively in a sequence
 * in this schedule and where all instances of the second depend on
 * the instance of the first that is executed in the same iteration
 * of outer band nodes are grouped together into a single statement.
 * The schedule constraints are then mapped to these groups of statements
 * and the resulting schedule is expanded again to refer to the original
 * statements.
