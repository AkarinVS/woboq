<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/Support/DataExtractor.h' l='170'>/// Extract a fixed length string from \a *OffsetPtr and consume \a Length
  /// bytes.
  ///
  /// Returns a StringRef for the string from the data at the offset
  /// pointed to by \a OffsetPtr. A fixed length C string will be extracted
  /// and the \a OffsetPtr will be advanced by \a Length bytes.
  ///
  /// \param[in,out] OffsetPtr
  ///     A pointer to an offset within the data that will be advanced
  ///     by the appropriate number of bytes if the value is extracted
  ///     correctly. If the offset is out of bounds or there are not
  ///     enough bytes to extract this value, the offset will be left
  ///     unmodified.
  ///
  /// \param[in] Length
  ///     The length of the fixed length string to extract. If there are not
  ///     enough bytes in the data to extract the full string, the offset will
  ///     be left unmodified.
  ///
  /// \param[in] TrimChars
  ///     A set of characters to trim from the end of the string. Fixed length
  ///     strings are commonly either NULL terminated by one or more zero
  ///     bytes. Some clients have one or more spaces at the end of the string,
  ///     but a good default is to trim the NULL characters.
  ///
  /// \return
  ///     A StringRef for the C string value in the data. If the offset
  ///     pointed to by \a OffsetPtr is out of bounds, or if the
  ///     offset plus the length of the C string is out of bounds,
  ///     a default-initialized StringRef will be returned.</doc>
