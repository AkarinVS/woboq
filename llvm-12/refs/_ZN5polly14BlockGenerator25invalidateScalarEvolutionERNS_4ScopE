  /// This function invalidates the scalar evolution results for all
  /// instructions that are part of a given scop, and the loops
  /// surrounding the users of merge blocks. This is necessary to ensure that
  /// later scops do not obtain scalar evolution expressions that reference
  /// values that earlier dominated the later scop, but have been moved in the
  /// conditional part of an earlier scop and consequently do not any more
  /// dominate the later scop.
