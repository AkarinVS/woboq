<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/AST/ParentMapContext.h' l='29'>/// Returns the parents of the given node (within the traversal scope).
  ///
  /// Note that this will lazily compute the parents of all nodes
  /// and store them for later retrieval. Thus, the first call is O(n)
  /// in the number of AST nodes.
  ///
  /// Caveats and FIXMEs:
  /// Calculating the parent map over all AST nodes will need to load the
  /// full AST. This can be undesirable in the case where the full AST is
  /// expensive to create (for example, when using precompiled header
  /// preambles). Thus, there are good opportunities for optimization here.
  /// One idea is to walk the given node downwards, looking for references
  /// to declaration contexts - once a declaration context is found, compute
  /// the parent map for the declaration context; if that can satisfy the
  /// request, loading the whole AST can be avoided. Note that this is made
  /// more complex by statements in templates having multiple parents - those
  /// problems can be solved by building closure over the templated parts of
  /// the AST, which also avoids touching large parts of the AST.
  /// Additionally, we will want to add an interface to already give a hint
  /// where to search for the parents, for example when looking at a statement
  /// inside a certain function.
  ///
  /// &apos;NodeT&apos; can be one of Decl, Stmt, Type, TypeLoc,
  /// NestedNameSpecifier or NestedNameSpecifierLoc.</doc>
