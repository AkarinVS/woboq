<doc f='llvm/lldb/include/lldb/Utility/Broadcaster.h' l='410'>/// BroadcasterImpl contains the actual Broadcaster implementation.  The
  /// Broadcaster makes a BroadcasterImpl which lives as long as it does.  The
  /// Listeners &amp; the Events hold a weak pointer to the BroadcasterImpl, so
  /// that they can survive if a Broadcaster they were listening to is
  /// destroyed w/o their being able to unregister from it (which can happen if
  /// the Broadcasters &amp; Listeners are being destroyed on separate threads
  /// simultaneously. The Broadcaster itself can&apos;t be shared out as a weak
  /// pointer, because some things that are broadcasters (e.g. the Target and
  /// the Process) are shared in their own right.
  ///
  /// For the most part, the Broadcaster functions dispatch to the
  /// BroadcasterImpl, and are documented in the public Broadcaster API above.</doc>
