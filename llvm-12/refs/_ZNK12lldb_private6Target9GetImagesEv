  /// Each process has a notion of a main executable that is the file
  /// that will be executed or attached to. Executable files can have
  /// dependent modules that are discovered from the object files, or
  /// discovered at runtime as things are dynamically loaded. After
  /// a main executable has been set, the images will contain a list
  /// of all the files that the executable depends upon as far as the
  /// object files know. These images will usually contain valid file
  /// virtual addresses only. When the process is launched or attached
  /// to, the DynamicLoader plug-in will discover where these images
  /// were loaded in memory and will resolve the load virtual
  /// addresses is each image, and also in images that are loaded by
  /// code.
