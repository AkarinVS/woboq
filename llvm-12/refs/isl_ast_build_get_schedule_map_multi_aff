 * schedule space in the form of an isl_multi_aff.
 * The internal schedule space originally corresponds to that of the
 * input schedule.  This may change during the code generation if
 * if isl_ast_build_insert_dim is ever called.
 * The external schedule space corresponds to the
 * loops that have been generated.
 *
 * Currently, the only difference between the internal schedule domain
 * and the external schedule domain is that some dimensions are projected
 * out in the external schedule domain.  In particular, the dimensions
 * for which no code has been generated yet and the dimensions that correspond
 * to eliminated loops.
 *
 * We cache a copy of the schedule_map in build-&gt;schedule_map.
 * The cache is cleared through isl_ast_build_reset_schedule_map
 * whenever anything changes that might affect the result of this function.
