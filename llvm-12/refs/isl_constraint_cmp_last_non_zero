 * In particular, the constraint that involves later variables or
 * that has a larger coefficient for a shared latest variable
 * is considered &quot;greater&quot; than the other constraint.
 *
 * Return -1 if &quot;c1&quot; is &quot;smaller&quot; than &quot;c2&quot;, 1 if &quot;c1&quot; is &quot;greater&quot;
 * than &quot;c2&quot; and 0 if they are equal.

 * If the constraints live in different local spaces, then we cannot
 * really compare the constraints so we compare the local spaces instead.
