   NULL), pointing to *N characters of space.  It is realloc&apos;d as
   necessary.  Returns the number of characters read (not including the
   null terminator), or -1 on error or EOF.

   These functions are not part of POSIX and therefore no official
   cancellation point.  But due to similarity with an POSIX interface
   or due to the implementation they are cancellation points and
   therefore not marked with __THROW.  */</doc>
