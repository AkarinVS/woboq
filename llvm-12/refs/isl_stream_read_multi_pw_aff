 *
 * The input format is similar to that of map, except that any conditions
 * on the domains should be specified inside the tuple since each
 * piecewise affine expression may have a different domain.
 * However, additional, shared conditions can also be specified.
 * This is especially useful for setting the explicit domain
 * of a zero-dimensional isl_multi_pw_aff.
 *
 * Since we do not know in advance if the isl_multi_pw_aff lives
 * in a set or a map space, we first read the first tuple and check
 * if it is followed by a &quot;-&gt;&quot;.  If so, we convert the tuple into
 * the domain of the isl_multi_pw_aff and read in the next tuple.
 * This tuple (or the first tuple if it was not followed by a &quot;-&gt;&quot;)
 * is then converted into the isl_multi_pw_aff through a call
 * to extract_mpa_from_tuple and the domain of the result
 * is intersected with the domain.
