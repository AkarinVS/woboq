 * \brief       Decode .xz Streams and .lzma files with autodetection
 *
 * This decoder autodetects between the .xz and .lzma file formats, and
 * calls lzma_stream_decoder() or lzma_alone_decoder() once the type
 * of the input file has been detected.
 *
 * \param       strm        Pointer to properly prepared lzma_stream
 * \param       memlimit    Memory usage limit as bytes. Use UINT64_MAX
 *                          to effectively disable the limiter. liblzma
 *                          5.2.3 and earlier don&apos;t allow 0 here and return
 *                          LZMA_PROG_ERROR; later versions treat 0 as if 1
 *                          had been specified.
 * \param       flags       Bitwise-or of flags, or zero for no flags.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: Initialization was successful.
 *              - LZMA_MEM_ERROR: Cannot allocate memory.
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: Unsupported flags
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR
