<doc f='llvm/lldb/source/Plugins/Process/elf-core/ProcessElfCore.cpp' l='761'>/// A description of a linux process usually contains the following NOTE
/// entries:
/// - NT_PRPSINFO - General process information like pid, uid, name, ...
/// - NT_SIGINFO - Information about the signal that terminated the process
/// - NT_AUXV - Process auxiliary vector
/// - NT_FILE - Files mapped into memory
/// 
/// Additionally, for each thread in the process the core file will contain at
/// least the NT_PRSTATUS note, containing the thread id and general purpose
