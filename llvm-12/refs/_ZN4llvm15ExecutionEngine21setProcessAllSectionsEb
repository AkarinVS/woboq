<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/ExecutionEngine/ExecutionEngine.h' l='428'>/// setProcessAllSections (MCJIT Only): By default, only sections that are
  /// &quot;required for execution&quot; are passed to the RTDyldMemoryManager, and other
  /// sections are discarded. Passing &apos;true&apos; to this method will cause
  /// RuntimeDyld to pass all sections to its RTDyldMemoryManager regardless
  /// of whether they are &quot;required to execute&quot; in the usual sense.
  ///
  /// Rationale: Some MCJIT clients want to be able to inspect metadata
  /// sections (e.g. Dwarf, Stack-maps) to enable functionality or analyze
  /// performance. Passing these sections to the memory manager allows the
  /// client to make policy about the relevant sections, rather than having
  /// MCJIT do it.</doc>
