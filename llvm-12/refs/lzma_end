 * \param       strm    Pointer to lzma_stream that is at least initialized
 *                      with LZMA_STREAM_INIT.
 *
 * After lzma_end(strm), strm-&gt;internal is guaranteed to be NULL. No other
 * members of the lzma_stream structure are touched.
 *
 * \note        zlib indicates an error if application end()s unfinished
 *              stream structure. liblzma doesn&apos;t do this, and assumes that
 *              application knows what it is doing.
