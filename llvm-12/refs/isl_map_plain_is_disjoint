 *
 * If one of them is empty or if they live in different spaces (ignoring
 * parameters), then they are clearly disjoint.
 * This is checked by isl_map_plain_is_disjoint_global.
 *
 * If they have different parameters, then we skip any further tests.
 *
 * If they are obviously equal, but not obviously empty, then we will
 * not be able to detect if they are disjoint.
 *
 * Otherwise we check if each basic map in &quot;map1&quot; is obviously disjoint
 * from each basic map in &quot;map2&quot;.
