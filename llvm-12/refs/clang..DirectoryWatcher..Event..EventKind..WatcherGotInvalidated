<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang/DirectoryWatcher/DirectoryWatcher.h' l='73'>/// The DirectoryWatcher that originated this event is no longer valid and
      /// its behavior is unspecified.
      ///
      /// The prime case is kernel signalling to OS-specific implementation of
      /// DirectoryWatcher some resource limit being hit.
      /// *Usually* kernel starts dropping or squashing events together after
      /// that and so would DirectoryWatcher. This means that *some* events
      /// might still be passed to Receiver but this behavior is unspecified.
      ///
      /// Another case is after the watched directory itself is deleted.
      /// WatcherGotInvalidated will be received at least once during
      /// DirectoryWatcher instance lifetime - when handling errors this is done
      /// on best effort basis, when an instance is being destroyed then this is
      /// guaranteed.
      ///
      /// The only proper response to this kind of event is to destruct the
      /// originating DirectoryWatcher instance and create a new one.</doc>
