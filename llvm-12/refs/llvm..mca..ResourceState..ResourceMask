<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/MCA/HardwareUnits/ResourceManager.h' l='138'>/// A resource mask. This is generated by the tool with the help of
  /// function `mca::computeProcResourceMasks&apos; (see Support.h).
  ///
  /// Field ResourceMask only has one bit set if this resource state describes a
  /// processor resource unit (i.e. this is not a group). That means, we can
  /// quickly check if a resource is a group by simply counting the number of
  /// bits that are set in the mask.
  ///
  /// The most significant bit of a mask (MSB) uniquely identifies a resource.
  /// Remaining bits are used to describe the composition of a group (Group).
  ///
  /// Example (little endian):
  ///            Resource |  Mask      |  MSB       |  Group
  ///            ---------+------------+------------+------------
  ///            A        |  0b000001  |  0b000001  |  0b000000
  ///                     |            |            |
  ///            B        |  0b000010  |  0b000010  |  0b000000
  ///                     |            |            |
  ///            C        |  0b010000  |  0b010000  |  0b000000
  ///                     |            |            |
  ///            D        |  0b110010  |  0b100000  |  0b010010
  ///
  /// In this example, resources A, B and C are processor resource units.
  /// Only resource D is a group resource, and it contains resources B and C.
  /// That is because MSB(B) and MSB(C) are both contained within Group(D).</doc>
