<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_ast_build.c' l='819'>/* Update the AST build based on the given loop bounds for
 * the current dimension and the stride information available in the build.
 *
 * We first make sure that the bounds do not refer to any iterators
 * that have already been eliminated.
 * Then, we check if the bounds imply that the current iterator
 * has a fixed value.
 * If they do and if this fixed value can be expressed as a single
 * affine expression, we eliminate the iterators from the bounds.
 * Note that we cannot simply plug in this single value using
 * isl_basic_set_preimage_multi_aff as the single value may only
 * be defined on a subset of the domain.  Plugging in the value
 * would restrict the build domain to this subset, while this
 * restriction may not be reflected in the generated code.
 * Finally, we intersect build-&gt;domain with the updated bounds.
 * We also add the stride constraint unless we have been able
 * to find a fixed value expressed as a single affine expression.
 *
 * Note that the check for a fixed value in update_values requires
 * us to intersect the bounds with the current build domain.
 * When we intersect build-&gt;domain with the updated bounds in
 * the final step, we make sure that these updated bounds have
 * not been intersected with the old build-&gt;domain.
 * Otherwise, we would indirectly intersect the build domain with itself,
 * which can lead to inefficiencies, in particular if the build domain
 * contains any unknown divs.
 *
 * The pending and generated sets are not updated by this function to
 * match the updated domain.
 * The caller still needs to call isl_ast_build_set_pending_generated.
