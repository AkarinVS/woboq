<doc f='llvm/lldb/source/Plugins/Process/gdb-remote/ProcessGDBRemote.cpp' l='99'>// Provide a function that can easily dump the packet history if we know a
// ProcessGDBRemote * value (which we can get from logs or from debugging). We
// need the function in the lldb namespace so it makes it into the final
// executable since the LLDB shared library only exports stuff in the lldb
// namespace. This allows you to attach with a debugger and call this function
// and get the packet history dumped to a file.</doc>
