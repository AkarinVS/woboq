  /// be done.
  ///
  /// \param[in] src

  /// \param[in] dst
  ///     The destination file/directory where \a src will be installed.
  ///     If \a dst has no filename specified, then its filename will
  ///     be set from \a src. It \a dst has no directory specified, it
  ///     will use the platform working directory. If \a dst has a
