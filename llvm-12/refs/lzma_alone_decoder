 * \brief       Initialize .lzma decoder (legacy file format)
 *
 * \param       strm        Pointer to properly prepared lzma_stream
 * \param       memlimit    Memory usage limit as bytes. Use UINT64_MAX
 *                          to effectively disable the limiter. liblzma
 *                          5.2.3 and earlier don&apos;t allow 0 here and return
 *                          LZMA_PROG_ERROR; later versions treat 0 as if 1
 *                          had been specified.
 *
 * Valid `action&apos; arguments to lzma_code() are LZMA_RUN and LZMA_FINISH.
 * There is no need to use LZMA_FINISH, but it&apos;s allowed because it may
 * simplify certain types of applications.
