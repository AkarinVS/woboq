/// This class works with SearchFilter to resolve function names and source
/// file locations to their concrete addresses.

/// General Outline:
/// The AddressResolver is a Searcher.  In that protocol, the SearchFilter
/// asks the question &quot;At what depth of the symbol context descent do you want
/// your callback to get called?&quot; of the filter.  The resolver answers this
/// question (in the GetDepth method) and provides the resolution callback.</doc>
