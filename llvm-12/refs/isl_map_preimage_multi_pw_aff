 * In other words, plug in &quot;mpa&quot; in the domain or range of &quot;map&quot;.
 * The result is a map that lives in the same space as &quot;map&quot;,
 * except that the space of type &quot;type&quot; has been replaced by
 * the domain space of &quot;mpa&quot;.
 *
 * If the map does not involve any constraints that refer to the
 * dimensions of the substituted space, then the only possible
 * effect of &quot;mpa&quot; on the map is to map the space to a different space.
 * We create a separate isl_multi_aff to effectuate this change
 * in order to avoid spurious splitting of the map along the pieces
 * of &quot;mpa&quot;.
 * If &quot;mpa&quot; has a non-trivial explicit domain, however,
 * then the full substitution should be performed.
