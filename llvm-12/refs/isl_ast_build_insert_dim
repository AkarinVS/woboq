<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_ast_build.c' l='1624'>/* Insert a single dimension in the schedule domain at position &quot;pos&quot;.
 * The new dimension is given an isl_id with the empty string as name.
 *
 * The main difficulty is updating build-&gt;options to reflect the
 * extra dimension.  This is handled in options_insert_dim.
 *
 * Note that because of the dimension manipulations, the resulting
 * schedule domain space will always be unnamed and unstructured.
 * However, the original schedule domain space may be named and/or
 * structured, so we have to take this possibility into account
 * while performing the transformations.
 *
 * Since the inserted schedule dimension is used by the caller
 * to differentiate between different domain spaces, there is
 * no longer a uniform mapping from the internal schedule space
 * to the input schedule space.  The internal2input mapping is
 * therefore removed.
