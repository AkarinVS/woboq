  /// The general organization of the table is complex, but the basic concepts
  /// are easy.  First there is a header which describes the location and
  /// organization of the three components that follow.
  ///  1. The landing pad site information describes the range of code covered
  ///     by the try.  In our case it&apos;s an accumulation of the ranges covered
  ///     by the invokes in the try.  There is also a reference to the landing
  ///     pad that handles the exception once processed.  Finally an index into
  ///     the actions table.
  ///  2. The action table, in our case, is composed of pairs of type ids
  ///     and next action offset.  Starting with the action index from the
  ///     landing pad site, each type Id is checked for a match to the current
  ///     exception.  If it matches then the exception and type id are passed
  ///     on to the landing pad.  Otherwise the next action is looked up.  This
  ///     chain is terminated with a next action of zero.  If no type id is
  ///     found the frame is unwound and handling continues.
  ///  3. Type id table contains references to all the C++ typeinfo for all
  ///     catches in the function.  This tables is reversed indexed base 1.
  ///
  /// Returns the starting symbol of an exception table.</doc>
