<doc f='llvm/lldb/source/Plugins/Process/elf-core/ProcessElfCore.cpp' l='573'>/// NetBSD specific Thread context from PT_NOTE segment
///
/// NetBSD ELF core files use notes to provide information about
/// the process&apos;s state.  The note name is &quot;NetBSD-CORE&quot; for
/// information that is global to the process, and &quot;NetBSD-CORE@nn&quot;,
/// where &quot;nn&quot; is the lwpid of the LWP that the information belongs
/// to (such as register state).
///
/// NetBSD uses the following note identifiers:
///
///      ELF_NOTE_NETBSD_CORE_PROCINFO (value 1)
///             Note is a &quot;netbsd_elfcore_procinfo&quot; structure.
///      ELF_NOTE_NETBSD_CORE_AUXV     (value 2; since NetBSD 8.0)
///             Note is an array of AuxInfo structures.
///
/// NetBSD also uses ptrace(2) request numbers (the ones that exist in
/// machine-dependent space) to identify register info notes.  The
/// info in such notes is in the same format that ptrace(2) would
/// export that information.
///
/// For more information see /usr/include/sys/exec_elf.h
