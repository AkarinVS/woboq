<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/Support/TrailingObjects.h' l='269'>// callNumTrailingObjects simply calls numTrailingObjects on the
  // provided Obj -- except when the type being queried is BaseTy
  // itself. There is always only one of the base object, so that case
  // is handled here. (An additional benefit of indirecting through
  // this function is that consumers only say &quot;friend
  // TrailingObjects&quot;, and thus, only this class itself can call the
  // numTrailingObjects function.)</doc>
