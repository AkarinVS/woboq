  ///
  /// If a core file contains both a kernel binary and a user-process
  /// dynamic loader, lldb needs to pick one over the other.  This could
  /// be a kernel corefile that happens to have a copy of dyld in its
  /// memory.  Or it could be a user process coredump of lldb while doing
  /// kernel debugging - so a copy of the kernel is in its heap.  This
  /// should become a setting so it can be over-ridden when necessary.</doc>
