 * \brief       Get progress information
 *
 * In single-threaded mode, applications can get progress information from
 * strm-&gt;total_in and strm-&gt;total_out. In multi-threaded mode this is less
 * useful because a significant amount of both input and output data gets
 * buffered internally by liblzma. This makes total_in and total_out give
 * misleading information and also makes the progress indicator updates
 * non-smooth.
 *
 * This function gives realistic progress information also in multi-threaded
 * mode by taking into account the progress made by each thread. In
 * single-threaded mode *progress_in and *progress_out are set to
 * strm-&gt;total_in and strm-&gt;total_out, respectively.
