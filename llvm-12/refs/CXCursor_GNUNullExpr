<doc f='llvm/clang/include/clang-c/Index.h' l='2019'>/** Implements the GNU __null extension, which is a name for a null
   * pointer constant that has integral type (e.g., int or long) and is the same
   * size and alignment as a pointer.
   *
   * The __null extension is typically only used by system headers, which define
   * NULL as __null in C++ rather than using 0 (which is an integer that may not
   * match the size of a pointer).
