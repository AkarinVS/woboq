 * the output dimension &quot;pos&quot; in terms of earlier dimensions.
 * The equality may also involve integer divisions, as long

 * parameters or input dimensions.
 * In this case, *div is set to the number of integer divisions and
 * *ineq is set to the number of inequality constraints (provided

 *
 * The equality may also involve a single integer division involving
 * the output dimensions (typically only output dimension &quot;pos&quot;) as
 * long as the coefficient of output dimension &quot;pos&quot; is 1 or -1 and
 * there is a pair of constraints i &gt;= l and i &lt;= l + n, with i referring
 * to output dimension &quot;pos&quot;, l an expression involving only earlier
 * dimensions and n smaller than the coefficient of the integer division
 * in the equality.  In this case, the output dimension can be defined
 * in terms of a modulo expression that does not involve the integer division.
 * *div is then set to this single integer division and
 * *ineq is set to the index of constraint i &gt;= l.
 *
 * Return bmap-&gt;n_eq if there is no such equality.
 * Return -1 on error.
