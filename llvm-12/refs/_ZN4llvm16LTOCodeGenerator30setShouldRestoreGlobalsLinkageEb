  /// When set, the linkage of globals will be restored prior to code
  /// generation. That is, a global symbol that had external linkage prior to
  /// LTO will be emitted with external linkage again; and a local will remain
  /// local. Note that this option only affects the end result - globals may
  /// still be internalized in the process of LTO and may be modified and/or
  /// deleted where legal.
  ///
  /// The default behavior will internalize globals (unless on the preserve
  /// list) and, if parallel code generation is enabled, will externalize
  /// all locals.</doc>
