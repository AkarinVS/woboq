 * and that is as &quot;simple&quot; as possible.
 *
 * The core computation is performed on the pure constraints.
 * When we add back the meaning of the integer divisions, we need
 * to (re)introduce the div constraints.  If we happen to have
 * discovered that some of these integer divisions are equal to
 * some affine combination of other variables, then these div
 * constraints may end up getting simplified in terms of the equalities,
 * resulting in extra inequalities on the other variables that
 * may have been removed already or that may not even have been
 * part of the input.  We try and remove those constraints of
 * this form that are most obviously redundant with respect to
 * the context.  We also remove those div constraints that are
 * redundant with respect to the other constraints in the result.
 *
 * The stride constraints among the equality constraints in &quot;bmap&quot; are
 * also simplified with respecting to the other equality constraints
 * in &quot;bmap&quot; and with respect to all equality constraints in &quot;context&quot;.
