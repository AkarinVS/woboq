<doc f='llvm/llvm/include/llvm/CodeGen/CodeGenPassBuilder.h' l='288'>/// addPreRewrite - Add passes to the optimized register allocation pipeline
  /// after register allocation is complete, but before virtual registers are
  /// rewritten to physical registers.
  ///
  /// These passes must preserve VirtRegMap and LiveIntervals, and when running
  /// after RABasic or RAGreedy, they should take advantage of LiveRegMatrix.
  /// When these passes run, VirtRegMap contains legal physreg assignments for
  /// all virtual registers.
  ///
  /// Note if the target overloads addRegAssignAndRewriteOptimized, this may not
  /// be honored. This is also not generally used for the the fast variant,
  /// where the allocation and rewriting are done in one pass.</doc>
