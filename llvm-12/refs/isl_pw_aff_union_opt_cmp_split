 * a set &quot;better&quot; where the piece from data_j-&gt;pw is better
 * than the piece from data_i-&gt;pw,
 * (further) update the specified cells such that only the better elements
 * remain on the (non-empty) intersection.
 *
 * Let C be the set &quot;better&quot;.
 * Let A be the cell data_i-&gt;cell[i] and B the cell data_j-&gt;cell[j].
 *
 * The elements in C need to be removed from A, except for those parts
 * that lie outside of B.  That is,
 *
 *	A &lt;- (A \setminus C) \cup ((A \cap C) \setminus B&apos;)
 *
 * Conversely, the elements in B need to be restricted to C, except
 * for those parts that lie outside of A.  That is
 *
 *	B &lt;- (B \cap C) \cup ((B \setminus C) \setminus A&apos;)
 *
 * Since all pairs of pieces are considered, the domains are updated
 * several times.  A and B refer to these updated domains
 * (kept track of in data_i-&gt;cell[i] and data_j-&gt;cell[j]), while A&apos; and B&apos; refer
 * to the original domains of the pieces.  It is safe to use these
 * original domains because the difference between, say, A&apos; and A is
 * the domains of pw2-pieces that have been removed before and
 * those domains are disjoint from B.  A&apos; is used instead of A
 * because the continued updating of A may result in this domain
 * getting broken up into more disjuncts.
