 * &quot;bset&quot; is a wrapped copy of the basic map that has the selected
 * output dimension as range.
 * &quot;pos&quot; is the position of the variable representing the output dimension,
 * i.e., the variable for which the size should be computed.  This variable
 * is also the last variable in &quot;bset&quot;.
 * &quot;size&quot; is the best size found so far
 * (infinity if no offset was found so far).
 * &quot;offset&quot; is the offset corresponding to the best size
 * (NULL if no offset was found so far).
