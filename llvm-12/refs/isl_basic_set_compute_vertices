<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_vertices.c' l='346'>/* Compute the parametric vertices and the chamber decomposition
 * of the parametric polytope defined using the same constraints
 * as &quot;bset&quot;.  &quot;bset&quot; is assumed to have no existentially quantified
 * variables.
 *
 * The vertices themselves are computed in a fairly simplistic way.
 * We simply run through all combinations of d constraints,
 * with d the number of set variables, and check if those d constraints
 * define a vertex.  To avoid the generation of duplicate vertices,
 * which we may happen if a vertex is defined by more that d constraints,
 * we make sure we only generate the vertex for the d constraints with
 * smallest index.
 *
 * We set up a tableau and keep track of which facets have been
 * selected.  The tableau is marked strict_redundant so that we can be
 * sure that any constraint that is marked redundant (and that is not
 * also marked zero) is not an equality.
 * If a constraint is marked DESELECTED, it means the constraint was
 * SELECTED before (in combination with the same selection of earlier
 * constraints).  If such a deselected constraint turns out to be an
 * equality, then any vertex that may still be found with the current
 * selection has already been generated when the constraint was selected.
 * A constraint is marked UNSELECTED when there is no way selecting
 * the constraint could lead to a vertex (in combination with the current
 * selection of earlier constraints).
 *
 * The set variable coefficients of the selected constraints are stored
 * in the facets matrix.
