<doc f='llvm/polly/lib/External/isl/isl_ast_codegen.c' l='5105'>/* Generate an AST that visits the elements in the domain of &quot;schedule&quot;
 * in the relative order specified by the corresponding image element(s).
 *
 * &quot;build&quot; is an isl_ast_build that has either been constructed by
 * isl_ast_build_from_context or passed to a callback set by
 * isl_ast_build_set_create_leaf.
 * In the first case, the space of the isl_ast_build is typically
 * a parametric space, although this is currently not enforced.
 * In the second case, the space is never a parametric space.
 * If the space S is not parametric, then the range space(s) of &quot;schedule&quot;
 * need to be wrapped relations with S as domain.
 *
 * If the range of &quot;schedule&quot; consists of several spaces, then an AST
 * is generated for each of them (in arbitrary order) and the results
 * are concatenated.
 *
 * We first initialize the local copies of the relevant options.
 * We do this here rather than when the isl_ast_build is created
 * because the options may have changed between the construction
 * of the isl_ast_build and the call to isl_generate_code.
 *
 * The main computation is performed on an inverse schedule (with
 * the schedule domain in the domain and the elements to be executed
 * in the range) called &quot;executed&quot;.
