 * \brief Set the filename for writing instrumentation data.
 *
 * Sets the filename to be used for subsequent calls to
 * \a __llvm_profile_write_file().
 *
 * \c Name is not copied, so it must remain valid.  Passing NULL resets the
 * filename logic to the default behaviour.
 *
 * Note: There may be multiple copies of the profile runtime (one for each
 * instrumented image/DSO). This API only modifies the filename within the
 * copy of the runtime available to the calling image.
 *
 * Warning: This is a no-op if continuous mode (\ref
 * __llvm_profile_is_continuous_mode_enabled) is on. The reason for this is
 * that in continuous mode, profile counters are mmap()&apos;d to the profile at
 * program initialization time. Support for transferring the mmap&apos;d profile
 * counts to a new file has not been implemented.
