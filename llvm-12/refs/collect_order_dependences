 * In particular, consider all references that access the given array
 * and take the order dependences that have one of these references
 * as source.  (Since an order dependence relates two references to
 * the same array, the target of these order dependences will also
 * be one of these references.)
 * Additionally, store the union of these array-&gt;dep_order relations
 * for all arrays that cannot be mapped to private memory in prog-&gt;array_order.
