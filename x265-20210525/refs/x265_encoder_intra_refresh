<doc f='x265/source/x265.h' l='2162'>/* x265_encoder_intra_refresh:
 *      If an intra refresh is not in progress, begin one with the next P-frame.
 *      If an intra refresh is in progress, begin one as soon as the current one finishes.
 *      Requires bIntraRefresh to be set.
 *
 *      Useful for interactive streaming where the client can tell the server that packet loss has
 *      occurred.  In this case, keyint can be set to an extremely high value so that intra refreshes
 *      occur only when calling x265_encoder_intra_refresh.
 *
 *      In multi-pass encoding, if x265_encoder_intra_refresh is called differently in each pass,
 *      behavior is undefined.
 *
 *      Should not be called during an x265_encoder_encode. */</doc>
