<doc f='x265/source/x265.h' l='2325'>/* x265_api_query:
 *   Retrieve the programming interface for a linked x265 library, like
 *   x265_api_get(), except this function accepts X265_BUILD as the second
 *   argument rather than using the build number as part of the function name.
 *   Applications which dynamically link to libx265 can use this interface to
 *   query the library API and achieve a relative amount of version skew
 *   flexibility. The function may return NULL if the library determines that
 *   the apiVersion that your application was compiled against is not compatible
 *   with the library you have linked with.
 *
 *   api_major_version will be incremented any time non-backward compatible
 *   changes are made to any public structures or functions. If
 *   api_major_version does not match X265_MAJOR_VERSION from the x265.h your
 *   application compiled against, your application must not use the returned
 *   x265_api pointer.
 *
 *   Users of this API *must* also validate the sizes of any structures which
 *   are not treated as opaque in application code. For instance, if your
 *   application dereferences a x265_param pointer, then it must check that
 *   api-&gt;sizeof_param matches the sizeof(x265_param) that your application
 *   compiled with. */</doc>
