 *
 * rd-level 0 generates no recon per CU (NO RDO or Quant)
 *
 *   sa8d selection between merge / skip / inter / intra and split
 *   no recon pixels generated until CTU analysis is complete, requiring
 *   intra predictions to use source pixels
 *
 * rd-level 1 uses RDO for merge and skip, sa8d for all else
 *
 *   RDO selection between merge and skip
 *   sa8d selection between (merge/skip) / inter modes / intra and split
 *   intra prediction uses reconstructed pixels
 *
 * rd-level 2 uses RDO for merge/skip and split
 *
 *   RDO selection between merge and skip
 *   sa8d selection between (merge/skip) / inter modes / intra
 *   RDO split decisions
 *
 * rd-level 3 uses RDO for merge/skip/best inter/intra
 *
 *   RDO selection between merge and skip
 *   sa8d selection of best inter mode
 *   sa8d decisions include chroma residual cost
 *   RDO selection between (merge/skip) / best inter mode / intra / split
 *
 * rd-level 4 enables RDOQuant
 *   chroma residual cost included in satd decisions, including subpel refine
 *    (as a result of --subme 3 being used by preset slow)
 *
 * rd-level 5,6 does RDO for each inter mode
