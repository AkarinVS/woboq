		 * \brief       Data is corrupt
		 *
		 * The usage of this return value is different in encoders
		 * and decoders. In both encoder and decoder, the coding
		 * cannot continue after this error.
		 *
		 * Encoders return this if size limits of the target file
		 * format would be exceeded. These limits are huge, thus
		 * getting this error from an encoder is mostly theoretical.
		 * For example, the maximum compressed and uncompressed
		 * size of a .xz Stream is roughly 8 EiB (2^63 bytes).
		 *
		 * Decoders return this error if the input data is corrupt.
		 * This can mean, for example, invalid CRC32 in headers
		 * or invalid check of uncompressed data.
