 * Merge the formats/channel layouts/samplerates lists if they are compatible
 * and update all the references of a and b to point to the combined list and
 * free the old lists as needed. The combined list usually contains the
 * intersection of the lists of a and b.
 *
 * Both a and b must have owners (i.e. refcount &gt; 0) for these functions.
 *
 * @return 1 if merging succeeded, 0 if a and b are incompatible
 *         and negative AVERROR code on failure.
 *         a and b are unmodified if 0 is returned.
