 * @addtogroup version_utils
 *
 * Useful to check and match library version in order to maintain
 * backward compatibility.
 *
 * The FFmpeg libraries follow a versioning sheme very similar to
 * Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/)
 * The difference is that the component called PATCH is called MICRO in FFmpeg
 * and its value is reset to 100 instead of 0 to keep it above or equal to 100.
 * Also we do not increase MICRO for every bugfix or change in git master.
 *
 * Prior to FFmpeg 3.2 point releases did not change any lib version number to
 * avoid aliassing different git master checkouts.
 * Starting with FFmpeg 3.2, the released library versions will occupy
 * a separate MAJOR.MINOR that is not used on the master development branch.
 * That is if we branch a release of master 55.10.123 we will bump to 55.11.100
 * for the release and master will continue at 55.12.100 after it. Each new
 * point release will then bump the MICRO improving the usefulness of the lib
 * versions.
