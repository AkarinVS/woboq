 * \brief       LZMA2 Filter ID
 *
 * Usually you want this instead of LZMA1. Compared to LZMA1, LZMA2 adds
 * support for LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH, uncompressed chunks (smaller expansion
 * when trying to compress uncompressible data), possibility to change
 * lc/lp/pb in the middle of encoding, and some other internal improvements.
