 * Hardware acceleration should still be attempted for decoding when the
 * codec profile does not match the reported capabilities of the hardware.
 *
 * For example, this can be used to try to decode baseline profile H.264
 * streams in hardware - it will often succeed, because many streams marked
 * as baseline profile actually conform to constrained baseline profile.
 *
 * @warning If the stream is actually not supported then the behaviour is
 *          undefined, and may include returning entirely incorrect output
 *          while indicating success.
