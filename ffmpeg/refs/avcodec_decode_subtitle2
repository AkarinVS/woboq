<doc f='ffmpeg/libavcodec/avcodec.h' l='3108'>/**
 * Decode a subtitle message.
 * Return a negative value on error, otherwise return the number of bytes used.
 * If no subtitle could be decompressed, got_sub_ptr is zero.
 * Otherwise, the subtitle is stored in *sub.
 * Note that AV_CODEC_CAP_DR1 is not available for subtitle codecs. This is for
 * simplicity, because the performance difference is expected to be negligible
 * and reusing a get_buffer written for video codecs would probably perform badly
 * due to a potentially very different allocation pattern.
 *
 * Some decoders (those marked with AV_CODEC_CAP_DELAY) have a delay between input
 * and output. This means that for some packets they will not immediately
 * produce decoded output and need to be flushed at the end of decoding to get
 * all the decoded data. Flushing is done by calling this function with packets
 * with avpkt-&gt;data set to NULL and avpkt-&gt;size set to 0 until it stops
 * returning subtitles. It is safe to flush even those decoders that are not
 * marked with AV_CODEC_CAP_DELAY, then no subtitles will be returned.
 *
 * @note The AVCodecContext MUST have been opened with @ref avcodec_open2()
 * before packets may be fed to the decoder.
 *
 * @param avctx the codec context
 * @param[out] sub The preallocated AVSubtitle in which the decoded subtitle will be stored,
 *                 must be freed with avsubtitle_free if *got_sub_ptr is set.
 * @param[in,out] got_sub_ptr Zero if no subtitle could be decompressed, otherwise, it is nonzero.
 * @param[in] avpkt The input AVPacket containing the input buffer.
