 * List of PCE (Program Configuration Element) for the channel layouts listed
 * in channel_layout.h
 *
 * For those wishing in the future to add other layouts:
 *
 * - num_ele: number of elements in each group of front, side, back, lfe channels
 *            (an element is of type SCE (single channel), CPE (channel pair) for
 *            the first 3 groups; and is LFE for LFE group).
 *
 * - pairing: 0 for an SCE element or 1 for a CPE; does not apply to LFE group
 *
 * - index: there are three independent indices for SCE, CPE and LFE;
 *     they are incremented irrespective of the group to which the element belongs;
 *     they are not reset when going from one group to another
 *
 *     Example: for 7.0 channel layout,
 *        .pairing = { { 1, 0 }, { 1 }, { 1 }, }, (3 CPE and 1 SCE in front group)
 *        .index = { { 0, 0 }, { 1 }, { 2 }, },
 *               (index is 0 for the single SCE but goes from 0 to 2 for the CPEs)
 *
 *     The index order impacts the channel ordering. But is otherwise arbitrary
 *     (the sequence could have been 2, 0, 1 instead of 0, 1, 2).
 *
 *     Spec allows for discontinuous indices, e.g. if one has a total of two SCE,
 *     SCE.0 SCE.15 is OK per spec; BUT it won&apos;t be decoded by our AAC decoder
 *     which at this time requires that indices fully cover some range starting
 *     from 0 (SCE.1 SCE.0 is OK but not SCE.0 SCE.15).
 *
 * - config_map: total number of elements and their types. Beware, the way the
 *               types are ordered impacts the final channel ordering.
 *
 * - reorder_map: reorders the channels.
