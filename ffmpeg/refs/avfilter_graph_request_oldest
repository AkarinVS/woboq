 *
 * Also note that AVERROR_EOF does not mean that frames did not arrive on
 * some of the sinks during the process.
 * When there are multiple sink links, in case the requested link
 * returns an EOF, this may cause a filter to flush pending frames
 * which are sent to another sink link, although unrequested.
