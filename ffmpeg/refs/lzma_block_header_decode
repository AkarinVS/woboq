 * \brief       Decode Block Header
 *
 * block-&gt;version should (usually) be set to the highest value supported
 * by the application. If the application sets block-&gt;version to a value
 * higher than supported by the current liblzma version, this function will
 * downgrade block-&gt;version to the highest value supported by it. Thus one
 * should check the value of block-&gt;version after calling this function if
 * block-&gt;version was set to a non-zero value and the application doesn&apos;t
 * otherwise know that the liblzma version being used is new enough to
 * support the specified block-&gt;version.
 *
 * The size of the Block Header must have already been decoded with
 * lzma_block_header_size_decode() macro and stored to block-&gt;header_size.
 *
 * The integrity check type from Stream Header must have been stored
 * to block-&gt;check.
 *
 * block-&gt;filters must have been allocated, but they don&apos;t need to be
 * initialized (possible existing filter options are not freed).
 *
 * \param       block       Destination for Block options.
 * \param       allocator   lzma_allocator for custom allocator functions.
 *                          Set to NULL to use malloc() (and also free()
 *                          if an error occurs).
 * \param       in          Beginning of the input buffer. This must be
 *                          at least block-&gt;header_size bytes.
 *
 * \return      - LZMA_OK: Decoding was successful. block-&gt;header_size
 *                bytes were read from the input buffer.
 *              - LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR: The Block Header specifies some
 *                unsupported options such as unsupported filters. This can
 *                happen also if block-&gt;version was set to a too low value
 *                compared to what would be required to properly represent
 *                the information stored in the Block Header.
 *              - LZMA_DATA_ERROR: Block Header is corrupt, for example,
 *                the CRC32 doesn&apos;t match.
 *              - LZMA_PROG_ERROR: Invalid arguments, for example
 *                block-&gt;header_size is invalid or block-&gt;filters is NULL.
