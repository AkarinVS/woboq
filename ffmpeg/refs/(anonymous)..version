	 * \brief       Stream Flags format version
	 *
	 * To prevent API and ABI breakages if new features are needed in
	 * Stream Header or Stream Footer, a version number is used to
	 * indicate which fields in this structure are in use. For now,
	 * version must always be zero. With non-zero version, the
	 * lzma_stream_header_encode() and lzma_stream_footer_encode()
	 * will return LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR.
	 *
	 * lzma_stream_header_decode() and lzma_stream_footer_decode()
	 * will always set this to the lowest value that supports all the
	 * features indicated by the Stream Flags field. The application
	 * must check that the version number set by the decoding functions
	 * is supported by the application. Otherwise it is possible that
	 * the application will decode the Stream incorrectly.

	 * \brief       Block format version
	 *
	 * To prevent API and ABI breakages when new features are needed,
	 * a version number is used to indicate which fields in this
	 * structure are in use:
	 *   - liblzma &gt;= 5.0.0: version = 0 is supported.
	 *   - liblzma &gt;= 5.1.4beta: Support for version = 1 was added,
	 *     which adds the ignore_check field.

	 * will return LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR (lzma_block_header_decode() works
